0,"Milestones in Cataloging In the case of the present study, Dr.Lehnus was interested in applying a method - in a non-standard way for that method - to a type of literature that had not been addressed so far. He proposed to begin with a single monograph on the subject ""cataloging,"" apply the method of citation analysis to the references of that work, and determine whether a core literature on cataloging could be discovered in this way. There are innumerable examples of core literatures in scientific fields obtained from journal articles or through the Science citation index, but research via the monograph in non- scientific subjects has been minimal.",cisi
1,"childhood psychosis. a description is given of the diagnostic criteria put forward by creak and her associates in 1961 for what they have called 'schizophrenic syndrome of childhood'. psychotic reactions in childhood are grouped into: (1) childhood schizophrenia, (2) organic states with psychosis, (3) mental subnormality with psychosis, (4) sensory deprivation, (5) neurosis, and (6) manic-depressive psychosis. it is suggested that the generic term 'psychosis' is the best available, and a classification is presented and discussed.",med

3,"Handbook of Comparative Librarianship The first part, written by myself, deals with 'Comparative librarianship and comparative method' and is intended for both teachers of comparative librarianship and their students. It can be approached in a number of ways: The first three chapters outline comparative librarianship and the theoretical basis of its methodology against the wider background of other comparative sciences and the scientific method. The three chapters following are purely practical and explain the various steps of writing a comparative study. The last chapter is intended for teachers. The second part, compiled by Mrs. MacKee, is a bibliographical guide to the main sources on librarianship throughout the world. It draws on the bibliographies collected by comparative librarianship students in the course of their project work, on replies to a questionnaire sent to the various library associations of the world, and on Mrs. MacKee's own collection of references gathered over a number of years.",cisi
4,"Design and Evaluation of Information Systems The co-joining of ""design"" with ""evaluation"" that is called for by this chapter posed organizational and inclusion-exclusion problems for the author. In part, ""design"" and ""evaluation"" prescribe two separate sets of activities, the former pertaining to the planning, development, and testing of new information system structures and modification of existing structures, the latter to appraisals and assessments of operational systems and system components. However, ""design"" includes not only the formulation of goals and objectives for systems but also provisions for evaluation in accordance with expectations. ""Evaluation"" applies to testing design concepts and to trying out preliminary implementations for the purpose of improving initial designs, as well as to the appraisal of operating systems. Appraisals at any stage of system operability may yield data that indicate the need for system modifications that require redesign and assessment. Thus, portions of ""design"" and ""evaluation"" are closely interrelated, as Katter demonstrated in his 1969 review. ""Design"" and ""evaluation"" may be examined methodologically or with respect to outcomes of the application of methodologies. Increasingly, designers and evaluators have been acknowledging the dependence of outcomes on sound procedural conceptualizations. The current literature discloses research on the processes of design and evaluation as well as on their products.",cisi
5,"a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds . a study of inviscid flow about air foils at high supersonic speeds . steady flow about curved airfoils at high supersonic speeds is investigated analyticially . with the assumption that air behaves as a diatomic gas, it is found the the shock-expansion method may be used to predict the flow about curved airfoils up to extremely high mach numbers, provided the flow deflection angles are not too close to those corresponding to shock detachment . this result applies not only to the determination of the surface pressure distribution, but also to the determination of the whole flow field about an airfoil . verification of this observation is obtained with the aid of the method of characteristics by extensive calculations of the pressure gradient and shock-wave curvature at the leading edge, and by calculations of the pressure distribution on a 10-percent-thick biconvex airfoil at 0 angle of attack . an approximation to the shock-expansion method for thin airfoils at high mach numbers is also investigated and is found to yield pressures in error by less than 10 percent at mach numbers above three and flow deflection angles up to 25 . this slender-airfoil method is relatively simple in form and thus may prove useful for some engineering purposes . effects of caloric imperfections of air manifest in disturbed flow fields at high mach numbers are investigated, particular attention being given to the reduction of the ratio of specific heats . so long as this ratio does not decrease appreciably below to include the effects of these imperfections, should be substantially as accurate as for ideal-gas flows . this observation is verfied with the aid of a generalized shock-expansion method and a generalized method of characteristics employed in forms applicable for local air temperatures up to about 5000 rankine . the slender-airfoil method is modified to employ an average value of the ratio of specific heats for a particular flow field . this simplified method has essentially the same accuracy for imperfect-gas flows as its counterpart has for ideal-gas flows . an approximate flow analysis is made at extremely high mach numbers where it is indicated that the ratio of specific heats may approach close to 1 . in this case, it is found that the shock-expansion method may be in considerable error,. however, the busemann method for the limit of infinite free-stream mach number and specific-heat ratio of 1 appears to apply with reasonable accuracy .",cran

12,The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is the ISRS component..

16,"Abstracting Concepts and Methods Graduate library school study of abstracting should be more than a how-to-do-it course. It should include general material on the characteristcs and types of abstracts, the historical development of abstracting publications, the abstract-publishing industry (especially in the United States), and the need for standards in the preparation and evaluation of the product. These topics we call concepts. The text includes a methods section containing instructions for writing various types of abstracts, and for editing and preparing abstracting publications. These detailed instructions are supplemented by examples and exercises in the appendix. There is a brief discussion of indexing of abstract publications. Research on automation has been treated extensively in this work, for we believe that the topic deserves greater emphasis than it has received in the past. Computer use is becoming increasingly important in all aspects of librarianship. Much research effort has been expended on the preparation and evaluation of computer-prepared abstracts and extracts. Students, librarians, and abstractors will benefit from knowing about this research and understanding how computer programs were researched to analyze text, select key sentences, and prepare extracts and abstracts. The benefits of this research are discussed. Abstracting is a key segment of the information industry. Opportunities are available for both full-time professionals and part-time or volunteer workers. Many librarians find such activities pleasant and rewarding, for they know they are contributing to the more effective use of stored information. One chapter is devoted to career opportunities for abstractors.",cisi

31,"Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology In spite of concerns expressed in the literature about the health and vigor of the field of information science and of its service-oriented institutions - libraries and information centers - the progress reviews in this volume provide grounds for optimism. Some of the trends that were commented on in Volume 6 have proved to be solid and important. For example, the movement toward rapid interactive access to major public and commercial data bases is not very strong, and it will probably not be many years before satisfying experience with this new mode of information access will help it become not merely an experimental innovation but the standard means of searching and using centrally (or regionally) held data. Three chapters in this volume touch on related aspects of the movement: Bennett's review of the user interface in interactive systems, Gechman's report on machine-readable bibliographic data bases, and Brandhorst and Eckert's review of document retrieval and dissemination systems. This volume also introduces a new Annual Review topic of potentially great importance for future libraries: video cartridges and cassettes. It is widely accepted that libraries and information centers will, in the coming years, shift the balance of their holdings in the direction of some of the newer media, and the chapter by Kletter and Hudson helps to define the potential and problems of some of the promising new media. Other new areas of interest are information system applications in the criminal justice system and information system applications in the humanities. In addition to these topics, this volume covers three of the core areas of information science, which we attempt to review on as close to an annual basis as possible: information needs and uses, document description and representation, and organization of information. This coverage is consistent with a newly developed Annual Review master plan for cyclic but flexible coverage of some 40 major areas of interest in library and information science.",cisi

42,"the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a moving monatomic fluid . the propagation of a nonuniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave into a moving monatomic fluid . an initially uniform magnetohydrodynamic shock wave of arbitrary strength propagates through a channel which consists of two portions of which one has uniform cross-sectional area while the other is of varying cross-sectional area . it is assumed that the flow in the nonuniform section in front of the shock is initially a uniform state and no perturbations (due to the area variations) of this flow reach the shock until the area variation is encountered . when the shock enters the nonuniform section, it is perturbed, the shock strength altered and the subsequent flow is nonisentropic . in addition to the perturbation due to the effect of the area variations on the initially uniform upstream flow, there are two further contributions--viz., a permanent perturbation caused directly by the area changes and a transient disturbance--which propagates with true sonic speed with respect to the flow behind the shock, due to reflections of the permanent perturbation at the shock . expressions for these various contributions are obtained . the results presented include as special cases propagation of a nonuniform conventional gas dynamic shock into a moving nonconduction fluid and propagation of a nonuniform hydromagnetic shock wave into a stationary fluid .",cran

Also, the computer program should be designed to require a relatively small amount of internal memory.. The present paper contains a description of the structure of a program that meets the above requirements.. The vocabulary of the data base is automatically expressed in terms of 8, 16 and 24 bit codes chosen to point to the natural spelling in a dictionary.. Thus file size is reduced without the necessity for extensive processing for decoding.. Use of a compressed bit string inverted index greatly reduces search time, and a storage management system enables long strings to be processed with use of a limited amount of internal storage.. Creation of ""reduced"" files and tables is an important feature of a program; it allows the files needed only by specific phases of the program to be designed to use a relatively small amount of internal storage and input-output time..",cisi

56,"Towards a Behavioral Theory of Communication This paper presents a conceptualization of information as related to the decision problems of the recipient. The orientation is toward a formal definition of behavioral elements in an individual's ""purposeful state"": specifically, these elements are his objectives, his valuation of each objective, his possible courses of action, the efficiency of each course of action in achieving each objective, and his probability of choice for each course of action. The amount of information in a purposeful state is explicitly defined in terms of the probabilities of choice of the available courses of action. The amount of information in a message is defined as the difference between the amount of information in the purposeful state following the message, and the amount of information in the purposeful state preceding the message. The amount of instruction in a purposeful state is defined in terms of the efficiencies of the available courses of action; and the amount of motivation is defined in terms of the values of the objectives.	The amounts of instruction and motivation in a message are defined, just as information is, by comparing the amounts in a purposeful state before and after receipt of the message. The value of a purposeful state to an individual is defined as a function of the amount of information, the amount of instruction, and the amount of motivation in the state.

Deviations from the exponential curve are clearly related to war, depression, and recovery.

Deviations from an exponential growth of 2.5 percent per year are negligible except for two ""pauses"" during world wars, after which the observations continue parallel to the theoretical curve.

62,"Least Cost Decision Rules for the Selection of Library Materials for Compact Storage For the last several decades library collections have been growing at exponential rates with no relief evident in the future.. To help ease the growing financial burden of housing their collections, many librarians have suggested employment compact storage depositories for little-used materials.. Two aspects to be considered in designing a storage system are: the fraction of the collection which is to be stored; and the criteria to be used for selecting materials for storage.. This study demonstrates that for a given selection criterion least-cost storage quantities can be assessed by balancing the large circulation costs and the small shelving costs associated with stored materials.. Two storage criteria, one based upon the age of the materials and the other utilizing the individual book usage rates, are discussed and compared.. For the age policy the objective is the determination of a least-cost critical age at which materials are transferred to storage and which defines the fraction of the collection that should be stored.. The model assumes that the circulation rate of the books decline with age according to an average geometric pattern of obsolescence.. The average time gap between the most recent circulations of books is utilized as the measure for rate of usage of a book.. The storage decision variable resulting from the minimization of the total cost function of the usage rate policy is a critical intercirculation gap, the maximum amount of time that a book should be permitted to remain in a working collection without being used.. Those books which are stored by the above rule might be those for which the time since last use exceeds the critical intercirculation gap.. Hence, although the least-cost selection rule is independent of the composite distribution of usage rates, the fraction of the collection stored depends upon the circulation activities of the individual libraries.. An empirical evaluation of the storage models was made using data collected from three libraries at Purdue University and estimates of cost parameters extracted from the literature.. Calculations for the least-cost decision rules and the related costs demonstrate that significant savings can be realized from storage of materials, but the calculations indicate that a large portion of the collection must be stored.. Comparisons of the age policy and the usage rate policy indicate that the latter criterion is preferred for all cases examined, including a situation where the usage rate policy is handicapped with a relatively high unit relocation cost.. Sensitivity analyses of the cost parameters for practical ranges of values show that the choice for the length of the planning horizon has a relatively insignificant effect on the decision rules; that changes in the capacity-related cost parameters will cause significant changes in the results; and that the rules are extremely sensitive to changes in the circulation cost differential.. An important component of the latter consideration is a rather subjective estimate for the cost of a service delay, which appears to have a potentially large influence on the decision rules..",cisi

84,"A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Banks Future users of large data banks must be protected from having to know how the data is organized in the machine (the internal representation). A prompting service which supplies such information is not a satisfactory solution.. Activities of users at terminals and most application programs should remain unaffected when the internal representation of data is changed and even when some aspects of the external representation are changed.. Changes in data representation will often be nedded as a result of changes in query, update, and report traffic and natural growth in the types of stored information.. Existing noninferential, formated data systems provide users with tree- structured files or slightly more general network models of the data.. In Section 1, inadequacies of these models are discussed.. A model based on n-ary relations, a normal form for data base relations, and the concept of a universal data sublanguage are introduced.. IN Section 2, certain operations (other than logical inference) are discussed and applied to the problems of redundancy and consistency in the user's model..",cisi

93,"A New Look at Reference Scattering It was first observed by Bradford that, for a large collection of journal references on a given subject, most of the articles are derived from a small proportion of the total titles. Bradford listed the journals concerned in order of decreasing productivity and, by plotting the logarithms of the cumulative totals of titles against the cumulative totals of relevant articles produced, he obtained a straight line. (Similar results have been obtained by many later workers. The pattern is illustrated by Table I which shows the distribution of references among journal titles obtained by the author during a study of literature usage in the petroleum industry.) On the basis of these results Bradford then formulated a simple mathematical model to describe reference scattering. Vickery later pointed out that this 'law of scattering' predicted not a straight line but a curve. Kendall has now provided a more refined statistical explanation of the straight line observed by Bradford.",cisi

The concept of a natural language information system is introduced as a framework for reviewing automated language processing effort by computational linguists and information scientists. In terms of this framework, the former have concentrated on automating the operations of the component for content analysis and representation, while the latter have emphasized the data management component. The complementary nature of these developments allows the postulation of an integrated approach to automated language processing. This approach, which is outlined in the final sections of the paper, incorporates current notions in linguistic theory and information science, as well as design features of recent computational linguistic models.",cisi

120,"discussion of solar proton events and manned space flights . discussion of solar proton events and manned space flights . as a result of studies made during the international geophysical year (igy) and the international geophysical cooperation (igc), it is known that a considerable fraction of large solar flares give rise to almost pure streams of protons which reach the earth and continue to arrive for as long as 11 days . the energies of these particles lie within a very steep spectrum extending from 20 to least 500 mev . because of the frequency of large flares during times of high solar activity, and owing to the long duration of each solar proton emission, these particles were present in detectable intensity near the top of the earth's atmosphere for about 15 percent of the time from 1957 to 1960 . the number of large flares that accelerated and released these particles during this three-year period was about 30 . the event that began on august 22, 1958 contributed greatly toward the understanding of the solar and terrestrial sequence of events, and in addition provided the first identification of the emitted particles . a flare on may of protons in the neighborhood of the earth that this phenomenon was recognized as an additional radiation hazard to manned vehicles in the high atmosphere and in most parts of the solar system . the three very intense events that occurred in july, 1959 further supported this conclusion, and the possibility of predicting such events became an important consideration . in addition to its value in the protection of human beings, effective forecasting clearly would be of great value in the detailed scientific study of this phenomenon . this paper presents a preliminary discussion of some aspects of predicting the arrival of protons at the earth following the appearance of solar activity features and, equally important, of forecasting the periods when this penetrating radiation is unlikely to occur .",cran

Data were collected on about 300 ideas created in a divisional laboratory of a major U.S. corporation.. In general, these data support the a priori propositions.. Further, data analysis suggests that two pieces of information are required before an idea is generated: 1) knowledge of a need, problem, or opportunity relevant to the company; and, 2) knowledge of a means or technique for satisfying the need, solving the problem, or capitalizing on the opportunity..

The search for rigorous formulation in linguistics has a much more serious motivation than mere concern for logical niceties or the desire to purify well-established methods of linguistic analysis. Precisely constructed models for linguistic structure can play an important role, both negative and positive, in the process of discovery itself. By pushing a precise but inadequate formulation to an unacceptable conclusion, we can often expose the exact source of this inadequacy and, consequently, gain a deeper understanding of the linguistic data. More positively, a formalized theory may automatically provide solutions for many problems other than those for which it was explicitly designed.

167,"Universals in Linguistic Theory We feel that a profound change has occurred in linguistic thinking in the last decade. It is not longer of any interest to describe one after another language 'anyhow' without regard to the relevance of the facts to general linguistic theory. As Ross put it, it makes no sense to talk about 'describing a language in terms of its own structure alone.' Toward the end of the conference, when it had become apparent that the general agreement did not encompass any currently explicitly formulated model, the question was raised: What should we be teaching our students? Langendoen's answer seems to us most apt: We should give them the ability to recognize a interesting linguistic problem when they see one, that is, one which throws some light - negative or positive - on our conceptions of what languages in general are like.",cisi

171,"Measuring the Quality of Library Service: A Handbook 	There is probably no measurement task which public servants face which is more difficult than that of measuring the quality of service. It is as difficult to measure the quality of hospital service, or of schools, or of social welfare programs, as it is to determine the quality of library service. It is equally as difficult to decide what actions to take in order to improve service. Legislators, urban and regional planners, consultants, boards of trustees, accrediting teams, librarians, and a host of other decision makers must act on the basis of some conclusions about the quality of service offered by library systems. This handbook is intended for these groups, and especially for practicing librarians. The pervasiveness of the problem across all public service institutions, however, leads us to hope that the handbook will be of interest to other groups.",cisi

They determine also the quality of its successive generations of management. Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility and the hope of future progress. The key question for top management is: ""What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about the most effective way to manage people?"" From the answer to this question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise. It will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.",cisi

The limited resources or libraries, particularly in the developing countries, do not permit them to increase library space or budget at a rate commensurate with this rise in publication.. Consequently research libraries in such countries as India must be highly selective in their acquisition programmes and to do so without detriment to the research interests of the institution they serve, they urgently need dependable data on the ranking of periodicals according to the particular research needs of their respective countries..

Departmental goals may restrict the manager to some maximum budget, a minimum number of projects to be worked on, and minimum levels of accomplishment on specific projects..

The working hypothesis was that the communication process between authors and readers is linear in nature (""one-way"" communication allowing no reciprocal feedback) if a thesaurus utilized in a system is not updated by both indexers and question negotiators.. Findings show that thesauri viewed from the communications point of view do not allow a cybernetic process of communication (""both-way"" communication).. The survey indicated that the present practice of updating thesauri is largely done by indexers alone.. No attempt was made to develop a theory of thesaurus construction and updating..

259,"2716. y-angiocardiography recordings were made, simultaneously with the y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an- giogram by means of a collimator placed in the left scapular region and of carotid angiogram by a collimator centered on the axis of the external auditory canal. the 3 curves yielded very interesting information on the chronology of the various car- diac cycles. the pattern of the pulmonary and carotid y-angiograms was valuable in several pathologic conditions. it is more logical to measure the cardiac output on the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram, especially if there are shunts. the pulmonary curve allows rectification of the time constant of emptying of the left cavities of the heart. as regards chronologic information on cardiac cycles, atten- tion is drawn to the fact that in the pulmonary circulation long and short circuits can be demonstrated. the characteristic times can be measured. between the time that the radioactive material appears in the left cavities and the time that it leaves the carotid, there is an interval of 3-4 systoles, which represents the time neces- sary for left circular filling. the validity of calculation of the cardiac output with the stewart-hamilton formula is discussed. this is valid if the collimator covers a small volume of the principal channel. it remains to be shown if such a calculation is valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, through which the radioactive material passes successively, and which have different c (t) functions as well as for all tissue 'seen' by the collimator, some of which are not yet irrigated with the radioactive blood, while in other areas recirculation has already started. these aspects, and their application to the pulmonary angiogram, are discussed in detail. with the authors' technique, y-angiogram is especially valuable, as correc- tion for the time constant of the decrease of the left peak is based on the lengthening of this curve. this again serves as a basis for determining the left ventricular volume.",med
260,"1770. proliferative activity of the lymphatic tissues of rats as studied with tritium-labelled thymidine cytokinetic data are presented, employing quantitation of h3dna in the lymphatic tissues of normal rats serially sacrificed after h3tdr administration. a marked difference in the patterns of initial labeling and label loss was observed between the thymus and peripheral lymphatic tissue. the data are compatible with other indica- tions of rapid cell renewal in the thymus. there is suppression of initial uptake of h3tdr into the dna of each large lymphocytic progenitor cell in the thymus, appa- rently because of a feedback of thymidine containing material from small lympho- cytes in the thymus. depletion of the thymus of small cells, as by operative stress or whole body x-ray, leads to a marked increase in the uptake of h3tdr into the dna of large thymocytes. this finding, which is in agreement with the previous findings of sugino et al. suggesting transfer of thymine nucleotides from small thy- mus lymphocytes to precursor cells, may or may not be related to the apparent transfer of dna label between thymic cells. the evidence for the latter consists of the curvilinear dilution of the dna label in the thymus proliferating cell population and the relationship between the rate of dna label dilution in large cells and the dna in the small cells in the thymus. after the dna label in progenitor cells in the thymus and lymph nodes has entered the small cell population, the subsequent dilution of grains in these dividing cells follows the same slope as the loss of radio- activity from the entire lymph node. there is a long retention of some h3dna label in the dividing lymph node cell population. this suggests that the loss of radioacti- vity from the dividing cells and from the small cell population as a whole occurs e- qually. this pattern prevails regardless of whether the percentage of large and small cells is altered experimentally. these findings can be explained by an inter- change of the dna nuclear label between small lymphocytes and large lymphocytes. this could occur by some process such as phagocytosis or pinocytosis, or by trans- formation of the small lymphocyte into a large, dividing cell. the data fit best with the latter possibility. all or any of these mechanisms would lead to an equilibration of the dna label between large and small cells. this finding prevents the assign- ment of a finite life span to lymphocytes on the basis of dna labeling kinetics. ne- vertheless, there appear to be at least two different types of lymphocytes. one, the 'thymus-type' lymphocyte, is found in the thymus cortex, bone marrow and ger- minal centers of lymphoid follicles. the other type, found abundantly in the wide- spread peripheral lymphatic tissue, shows a very prolonged retention of dna la- bel and is believed to be recirculating, 'immunologically committed' cells described by others. these cells do not appear to enter the thymus cortex.",med

271,"The Crisis in Cataloging A wise German librarian has linked the library administrator and the cataloger as working for the common aim of economy in work and cost coupled with better utilization of a library's resources. This aim, he thinks, is expressed in various kinds of cooperative work, of pooling interests, and of setting standards. It is to be developed prudently, he says, with the objectives setting limitations in such a way that more values will not be destroyed than are created. This ideal he set out in a chapter entitled ""Tasks for the future."" There was a time, and not so very far back, when the library administrator and the cataloger worked side by side. In the more immediate past, however, the two have become separated, so that their closer collaboration does need to be set down as a task for the future, the immediate future at that. Many new problems of administration have served to busy the administrator, and most catalogers have had more work than enough, with the result that administrators have come to know less and less of cataloging, and catalogers have come to know less and less about general library administration. The situation now is that the administrator will be forced to pay more attention to cataloging because it has become a major problem field.",cisi

The computable methods derived are offered as potentially useful tools for taxonomists, rather than as substitutes for their activities. Superficially similar problems of data simplification arise in pattern recognition and in the various sciences which make substantial use of classificatory systems: biological taxonomy, ecology, psychology, linguistics, archaeology, sociology, etc. But more detailed examination shows that the kinds of classification used and the kinds of data on which they are based differ widely from science to science. Whilst we recognize that some of the methods described here, particularly in Part II of the book, are more widely applicable, we have deliberately limited discussion to biological taxonomy. The emphasis throughout is on the clarification of the mathematical properties of methods of automatic classification and of the conditions under which their application is valid, so that anyone who wishes to apply the methods in other fields shall be aware of their limitations, and of the lines along which they may profitably be developed and modified.",cisi

As is well known, a great deal of this has been due to Dr. Ranganathan, and also, in more recent years, to Mr. B. C. Vickery. As a result of these developments, a coherent theory of library classification has been established in each of its three major departments - in subject analysis, in notation, and in the alphabetical indexing of systematic orders. It is now possible to construct library classifications whose efficiency in the two basic functions (of relating subjects helpfully, and of locating them rapidly ad unerringly) is considerably greater than the schemes we have so far used.

298,"torispherical shells - a caution to designers . torispherical shells - a caution to designers . it has recently become apparent, through a rigorous stress analysis of a specific case that designing torispherical shells by the current edition of the asme code on unfired pressure vessels can lead to failure during proof-testing of the vessel . the purpose of the present paper is to show in what respects the code fails to give accurate results . as an illustrative example, a hypothetical pressure vessel with a torispherical head having a diameter-thickness ratio of 440 was selected . the supports of the vessel were considered to be either on the main cylinder or around the torus . the vessel was subjected to internal pressure and the elastic stresses in it were determined rigorously and by the code . a comparison of the two revealed that the code predicted stresses in the head which were less than one half of those actually occurring . furthermore, the code gave no indication of the presence of high compressive circumferential direct stresses which exceeded 30,000 psi for practically the entire torus . if the head had been fabricated using a steel with a yield point of would have failed or undergone large deformations, whereas the code would have predicted that it was safe . the code's rules for torispherical heads are thus in need of revision for certain geometries . the implications of the foregoing results are currently being studied by the asme,. in the interim, however, designers should exercise care in applying the code to torispherical shells . it is also shown in the paper that the use of the membrane state as a particular solution of the differential equations is not a good approximation for toroidal shells of the type considered .",cran

Yet today we can see clearly two relatively new spectacles on the library scene: on the one hand, some librarians are criticizing the Decimal Classification (especially as used in the British National Bibliography) for being too detailed and unwieldy; on the other hand, some librarians, and still more information officers, are busy revising the Universal Decimal Classification in order to make it more detailed.

315,"Relevance Predictability in Information Retrieval Systems An experiment is described which attempts to derive quantitative indicators regarding the potential relevance predictability of the intermediate stimuli used to represent documents in information retrieval systems. In effect, since the decision to peruse an entire document is often predicated upon the examination of one ""level of processing"" of the document (e.g., the citation and/or abstract), it became interesting to analyze the properties of what constitutes ""relevance"". However, prior to such an analysis, an even more elementary step had to be made, namely, to determine what portions of a document should be examined. An evaluation of the ability of intermediate response products (IRPs), functioning as cues to the information content of full documents, to predict the relevance determination that would be subsequently made on these documents by motivated users of information retrieval systems, was made under controlled experimental conditions. The hypothesis that there might be other intermediate response products (selected extracts from the document i.e., first paragraph, last paragraph, and the combination of first and last paragraph), that would be representative of the full document as the traditional IRPs (citation and abstract) was tested systematically. The results showed that: 1. there is no significant difference among the several IRP treatment groups on the number of cue evaluations of relevancy which match the subsequent user relevancy decision on the document; 2. first and last paragraph combinations have consistently predicted relevancy to a higher degree that the other IRPs; 3. abstracts were undistinguished as predictors; and 4. the apparent high predictability rating for citations was not substantive.

347,"theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers . theoretical and experimental investigation of aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic mach numbers . the effect of a strong, negative pressure gradient upon the local rate of heat transfer through a laminar boundary layer on the isothermal surface of an electrically heated, cylindrical body of revolution with a hemispherical nose was determined from wind-tunnel tests at a mach number of 1.97 . the investigation indicated that the local heat-transfer parameter, based on flow conditions just outside the boundary layer, decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at the stagnation point of the hemisphere to a value of 0.43 0.05 at the junction with the cylindrical afterbody . because measurements of the static pressure distribution over the hemisphere indicated that the local flow pattern tended to become stationary as the free-stream mach number was increased to 3.8, this distribution of heat-transfer parameter is believed representative of all mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of temperatures less than that of dissociation . the local heat-transfer parameter was independent of reynolds number based on body diameter in the range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 . the measured distribution of heat-transfer parameter agreed within theoretical distribution calculated with foreknowledge only of the pressure distribution about the body . this method, applicable to any body of revolution with an isothermal surface, combines the mangler transformation, stewartson transformation, and thermal solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow problem, and thus evaluates the heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric compressible flow in terms of the known heat-transfer rate in an approximately equivalent two-dimensional incompressible flow . measurements of recovery-temperature distributions at mach numbers of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery factors having an average value of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which increased abruptly at the shoulder to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on the cylindrical afterbody . this result suggests that the usual representation of the laminar recovery factor as the square root of the prandtl number is conservative in the presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .",cran

The size of that population grows constantly, its educational level keeps climbing, and its percentage of leisure time is increasing. The application of computer technology to libraries, especially to the manipulation of bibliographic records in the performance of library functions, is a complex process and demands the highest level of talent of both the library and computer professions for its accomplishment. It cannot be accomplished by either profession alone; rather, the design of a library system is a team effort between librarians, computer system analysts, and programmers. Even a limited effort demands careful long-term planning if it is to fit with later efforts into a cohesive whole. The smallest project will affect nearly all operations of the library. For these reasons it is necessary that all library staff have at least a general overview of what library automation is all about.",cisi

Thus a basis for comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs of service to the disadvantaged might move. To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities. In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or effectiveness of the program.",cisi

430,"1577. mode of action of selenium in relation to biological activity of tocopherols dietary selenium at levels below 1 ppm has a partially beneficial effect upon nutritional muscular dystrophy but is ineffective or detrimental at higher levels. the role of selenium in improving the effectiveness of vitamin e is due at least in part to the fact that dietary selenium increases the retention of the a-tocopherols, especially d-a-tocopherol. this has been shown by chemical determination of plasma tocopherols and also by tracing the activities of tritiated tocopherols and selenium75 in serum and in various fractions of serum proteins in chicks receiving these nutrients alone and in combination. se75 and h3-a-tocopherol activities followed each other very closely in the serum proteins. these studies indicated that vitamin e may be carried by a selenolipoprotein fraction associated with serum y-globulin. thus, one biological role of selenium appears to lie in a selenium-containing compound which acts as a carrier of vitamin e and which may function in absorption, retention, prevention of destruction, and perhaps transfer across cell membranes of d-a-tocopherol, thereby enhancing its biological activity in the blood and perhaps in cells throughout the body.",med

Without information and its necessary control, a society is not only stagnant, but regressive. With social memory, preserved and controlled by archives and libraries, a society is able to evolve to whatever future it is destined to experience in an ever-changing environment. Archives were the forerunners of libraries. The ancient archives contained the best of society's accumulated knowledge; and as nations grew in wealth and security, archives and libraries become symbols of a country's aspiration to create a better society. Today, archives and libraries are necessities. These cultural institutions pass information to succeeding generations in a variety of forms of distributable media. In this way, archives and libraries preserve the memory of civilization and pass this memory on to living individuals.

471,"the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterus of the newborn. administration of naturally occurring steroids (estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone) between the 7th and the 11th day of life increases the bilirubin level of these newborns. administration of the same steroids or of progesterone to nursing mothers results in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants. these facts explain the pathogenesis of neonatal jaundice. interpretation of the experimental and clinical findings leads to the conclusion that the high amount of steroid hormones which must be excreted during the neonatal period in conjunction with the relative insufficiency of the neonatal liver is responsible for the inability to conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid. the steroid hormones probably compete with bilirubin for the enzyme and substrate necessary for conjugation. the functional capacity of the neonatal liver is not high enough to conjugate both bilirubin and steroids. only after excretion of the placental steroids does sufficient conjugation of bilirubin become possible. furthermore, pregnanediol appears to inhibit the enzyme glucuronyl transferase. these mechanisms show the importance of steroid hormones in the pathogenesis of neonatal jaundice and their importance as an aggravating factor in the development of jaundice due to erythroblastosis. these newly developed concepts may have therapeutic implications on which the author will report at a later date.",med

Scientists themselves, faced with these criticisms, have been forced to consider, effectively for the first time, how the work they are doing is connected with the social and economic developments which are occurring around them. This book is an attempt to analyze this connection; to investigate how far scientists, individually and collectively, are responsible for this state of affairs, and to suggest what possible steps could be taken which would lead to a fruitful and not to a destructive utilization of science.",cisi
498,"fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise temperature variations . fundamentals of boundary layer heat transfer with streamwise temperature variations . boundary-layer heat transfer is analyzed for the case of a sinusoidal distribution of temperature in the direction of flow . it is shown that for both laminar and turbulent flow the spatial distribution of heat transfer is generally out of phase with the wall temperature by an angle of 30 to 45 . this leads to the conclusion that in some areas the heat flow is opposite to the temperature difference as used in the definition of the heat-transfer coefficient, and points to the basic shortcomings of this concept . the physical explanation for this behavior is found to be the temperature-field distortion by the fluid motion . the distortion is measured by the peclet number . approximate equations representing a /conduction analogy/ were used in this analysis and the validity of these equations for unsteady flow is examined with reference to limitations in frequency and wavelength . a solution of these equations is given for the case of a velocity profile which is not a straight line . the use of previously developed variational principles for the evaluation of convective heat transfer including cases of three-dimensional unsteady flow, turbulence, and nonparallel streamlines is also discussed .",cran
499,"The Divided Catalog As early as 1905 the divided catalog was being presented as a preferable alternative to the dictionary catalog. Writing in 1958 Dorothy Grosser found that the steady stream of papers on the subject began in 1938. She reported 21 articles based on actual experience with the divided catalog. A quick check of her list discloses that all divided catalogs are not represented by articles. She recorded nine opponents of the divided catalog and six better known members of the profession reserving judgement. Lyle in his new edition of The Administration of the College Library considers it ""safer,"" rather than ""wiser"" as in his earlier edition, to await further evidence. Faced at Central Methodist College Library with a dictionary catalog which had outgrown its cabinets and which was to be expanded, a survey of catalog user opinion was undertaken to determine if some division of the catalog should be considered. Some revision of the filing would be needed anyway because of inconsistencies which had crept in, largely involving the inter-filing of subject and title entries. The following questions were asked of all users of the catalog during hours selected at random over several weeks: 1. Are you looking for a particular book or for books on a particular subject? Were you looking under author, title, or subject? 2. What is your greatest difficulty in using the catalog? 3. How would you feel about having the subject cards in a separate file? One hundred persons, approximately one tenth of the campus population, were questioned; 93 per cent felt that they would prefer having subject cards in a separate catalog, 5 per cent were opposed, and 2 per cent undecided. It must be admitted that the prejudice of the person asking may have influenced the way in which the question was answered - a similar survey made in 1954 by the University of Toronto showed general support for the dictionary catalog.",cisi

The system, called AIM-TWX, was sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California.. Citations from 109 clinically-oriented journals from 1966 to date, including those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved either on- or off-line.. Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH vocabulary which is the principle ""language"" of the man-computer dialog.. The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately 200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was highly successful in terms of searches and citations.. At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors, and 5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large number of medical practitioners in large and small communities of Virginia participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with great rapidity..",cisi
504,"studies on growth hormone secretion in rats with the hypophysis autotransplanted to the kidney capsule the secretory capacity of the pituitary gland, autotransplanted to the kidney capsule, was studied with special regard to the secretion of growth hormone (gh). body weight, body length, tibial epiphyseal width and the mammary gland development after testosterone stimulation were studied. body growth and tibial epiphyseal width were markedly reduced in the rats with transplanted hypophysis, but not as much as in the hypophys- ectomized controls. after injections of 0.25 mg testosterone propionate daily for 10 days, only a few groups of alveoli were seen in the mam- mary glands of the transplanted rats. these observations show that there is a considerable deficiency of gh in rats with the pituitary gland auto- transplanted to the kidney capsule. however, the development of a few alveoli in the mammary glands is in favour of the theory that a small amount of gh is secreted from the transplanted pituitary tissue. injections of a purified vasopressin preparation (pitressin) in the rats with autotransplanted hypophysis did not influence body growth, tibial epiphyseal width or mammary gland development. further, no effect of pitressin was seen on the tibial epiphyseal cartilage of rats with intact pituitary gland as has been reported by del vecchio et al.

543,"Growth and Decay Curves in Scientific Citations In a rapidly advancing scientific discipline, new contributions will supersede older ones.. This selection in favor of recent literature should be observable in the distribution of footnote citations in a given discipline, by age of article cited.. However, the age distribution of citations also depends on the rate of growth of the disciplinary literature.. The effect of growth of the literature and of selection favoring recent articles can be separated, if certain assumptions hold, by use of an exponential model that expands and clarifies earlier findings by Price.. This model provides a reasonably good fit to age-distributions of footnotes in several disciplines, and its application suggest that citations in sociology tend to refer to older articles than those in the natural sciences..A parameter in the model, measuring the degree of selectivity in favor of recent articles, can be estimated and may be useful in comparative studies of the communication systems of various disciplines..",cisi

This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes, in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded discourse and behaviour appertaining to it. In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the cumulative yield from a given input. The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is, the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant. This type of behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations appropriate to the particular fields. Thus it has received many names according to its exponents, in both senses of that word.",cisi

589,"a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells . a nonlinear theory of bending and buckling of thin elastic shallow spherical shells . a shallow spherical dome subjected to lateral pressure is a structure for which the deformation departs appreciably from the linear theory at relatively small values of the deflection amplitude . it is also one for which the buckling process is characterized by a rapid decrease in the equilibrium load once the buckling load has been surpassed . for structures having this type of buckling characteristics the question arises as to whether the proper buckling criterion to apply is the classical criterion, which considers equilibrium with respect to infinitesimal displacements, or the finite-displacement /energy criterion/ proposed by tsien . in this paper the problem of the finite displacement and buckling of a shallow spherical dome is investigated both theoretically and experimentally . in the theoretical approach the nonlinear equations are converted into a sequence of linear equations by expanding all of the variables in powers of the center deflection and then equating the coefficients of equal powers . the basic parameter for the shallow dome is proportional to the ratio of the central height of the dome h to its thickness t . for small values of this ratio the expansions converge rapidly and enough terms are computed to determine the buckling load according to the classical criterion . for higher values of h t, convergence deteriorates rapidly and it was not possible to determine the buckling load with the number of terms which were computed . however even for these higher values of h t the deflection shapes are determined for deflection amplitudes below the amplitude at which buckling occurs . these deflection shapes are characterized by their rapid change as h t increases and by the fact that, over most of the range of h t studied, the maximum deflection does not occur at the center of the dome . experimental results seem to indicate that the classical criterion of buckling is applicable to very shallow spherical domes for which the theoretical calculation was made . a transition to energy criterion for higher domes is also indicated .",cran

(2) qualitative and quantitative changes which occur in the protein of normal lenses with advancing age show a character similar to those in senile cataract, however, they are less pronounced. in this instance, the de- crease in the quantity of soluble protein is likewise closely associated with the diminution of the protein content in the slow fractions of the electropherogram. (3) the changes in the soluble protein content of the lens and the alterations of the protein amounts in the slow fractions which always accompany the former, play the principal role in the aging process of the lens and in the development of senile cataract. (4) the investigations seem to indicate that the aging processes, of lenses as well as the development of senile cataract are of a similar character, but of different intensity. (5) undoubtedly, the processes of transition from slow fractions of soluble protein into faster ones and the transformation of part of the soluble protein into insoluble protein which is likely to be associated with these processes as well as the partial disappearance of total protein from the lens seem to play a very important part in the mechanisms pertaining to the development of cataract.",med

This book examines several aspects of a single basic question: is the stratification of individuals in science based upon the quality of scientific performance, or does discrimination obtain in the processes of status attainment?

624,"Bibliographical Statistics as a Guide to Growth Points in Science Efforts have been made in recent years to use statistical studies of scientific research papers as a means for deriving general statements about trends in science. For example, there has been a continuing interest in the question of how the frequency of citation of a scientific paper depends on its age. These investigations have, however, been mainly concerned with the major branches of science only, and have also, perhaps, been rather more interested in identifying past trends than in making specific predictions for the future. Although such results are obviously valuable, it is also important to push these analyses further into smaller areas within a main scientific subject division, since such areas may have significantly different bibliographical properties from the subject average. One particularly important aspect of such work concerns the origin of new growth areas within a major discipline. We can specifically pose the question: is it possible, purely from a statistical analysis of scientific research papers, to identify the appearance of a new growth area and, if so, how soon after its first appearance can such an area be identified?",cisi

649,"1388. optic agnosia semeiological and pathogenetic aspects the authors discuss the classical concept of agnosia and make a survey of pathogenetical factors which determine its phenomenology. the original and traditional concept of such a term implied the loss of the capacity to recognize objects, when the functions of sense organs are undamaged. the psychological studies on perception and the modern physiology of vision allow to avoid the dichotomy between sensation and perception and to affirm their identity. cortex and recptors are closely bound and function in unison. every cortical alteration is thus reflected in sensorial functions; it is therefore that on practical semeiological grounds it is possible to obtain a congruous information of the corresponding cortical functionality through an exploration of sense organs carried out by suitable means. since we are confronted with functional changes, exploration methods must be fit to evaluate dynamic aspects of perception in connection with the temporalization and spatialization of stimuli. such methods are now quite numerous and often complex a particular stress is laid on local adaptation, flicker fusion, and tachistoscopy on account of their significance and suitability. by such methods it is possible to show those functional deficits or pathological disturbances of sensorial functions which are also behind the pathology of visual recognition. fluctuation, extinction, alteration in the perception of movement, both real and apparent, changes in adaptation to light and darkness are all phenomena which can be detected instrumentally and which, at the same time, may be of determinant importance for the onset of 'agnosic' behaviour. the complexity of the latter, on the other hand, cannot always be explained by sensorial disturbances only other mechanisms, with a function complementary but not less indispensable to the dynamics of perceptive processes, may intervene and interfere in it. on the basis of the latest neurophysiological data the attention is called to ocular motility and proprioceptivity, centrifugal innervation of sensorial receptors, and vestibular afferences. a particular clinico-pathogenetical significance is attached by the authors to the association of lateral visual disturbances with altered proprioceptive and kinesthetic information from the corresponding half-body such association in fact is nearly always present among the factors responsible for the most strictly 'spatial' errors of 'agnosic' pathology. in the light of these pathogenetical considerations as well as of suitable semeiological findings, the authors deem it convenient to divide their cases into 3 categories with distinct clinical features (a) cases in which altered visual behaviour may be related to changes of the visual function and of its complementary mechanisms; (b) cases in which hemianopia is associated with a homolateral deficit of somatic proprioceptivity; (c) cases in which the changes in behaviour are chiefly, but not only, due to a dissolution of the symbolic sphere.",med

When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory..

667,"Automatic Abstracting and Indexing.. II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods of the automatic abstracting system is warranted..",cisi

708,"1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and the carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman and the fetus in 20 parturient women who were given glucose infusions during the expulsive stage of labor, the authors were able to observe an unusual hyperglycemia and a decrease in unesterified fatty acids (uefa). the uefa-level usually increases regularly during delivery. likewise, the values of esterified fatty acids (efa) showed an in- crease above the normally present levels in women who had received a glucose in- fusion during the expulsive stage of labor. the results show that during delivery both hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoids are predominantly due to the energy demands of the organism. however, there is also evidence that other, hitherto un- known factors may play a role. in the fetus, the infusion of glucose leads to an in- creased glucose retention. the infusion, however, does not bring about a decrease, but, contrary to the expectations, an increase in the uefa-values. in general, such a reaction is not found in any of the subsequent periods of life. further inves- tigations were conducted in order to find an explanation for the paradox uefa- reaction. as shown by an analysis of the lactic acid and the pyruvic acid values, the increase in the uefa can most probably not be attributed to an impairment in the fetal metabolic conditions. the administration of physiological saline infusions to 10 parturient women under equal conditions revealed that the cause for the uefa- increase can apparently neither be found in hemodynamic changes due to the infusion nor in changes of the electrolyte balance, but rather in an adaptation insufficiency of the fetal islet cells, respectively in a different fat mobilization or fat deposition.",med

The word ""inquiry"" suggests that the audience includes persons interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so on. Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science. I could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific problem of inquiry to the ""whole system.""",cisi
751,"Standard Costing for Information Systems: Background to a Current Study For some time past, interest has been developing within the Aslib Research Department in the problems of establishing standard costs for information systems. A literature search recently conducted by the Department (R. Reynolds) has revealed a scarcity of usable information on this subject: such data as is available is difficult to evaluate comparatively because of the differing definitions of the operations costed and of the terms used to describe them. It would seem, therefore, that a first step towards developing a costing method of widespread application would be the establishment of standard conventions for the analysis of information systems. One might postulate two possible ways of arriving at comparative costs for these systems, namely: (a) General survey method: The overall costs of a large number of information systems are broken down into a small number of categories, and analysed for correlation (see, for example, C.J. Wessel et al). (b) In-depth study: A small number of systems are studied in detail in an attempt to establish the true sources of the costs and factors affecting them. In a current project, we are attempting to apply method (b) to the production of current-awareness bulletins. An outline of some of the preliminary work in this project follows.",cisi
752,"metabolism and excretion of bilirubin c in experimental obstructive jaundice. bile duct ligation was carried out in a series of rhesus monkeys. the time required for the serum bilirubin to stop rising and achieve a relatively stable level, and the average serum bilirubin reached, paralleled closely that seen clinically. after the serum bilirubin levels had stopped rising and a 'steady state' had been reached, radioactive bilirubin was injected i.v. the radioisotope was distributed principally extravascularly and not in the same ratio as albumin, as in other forms of jaundice. daily turnover of bilirubin was found to be double that anticipated from normal hb breakdown, suggesting increased bilirubin production in obstructive jaundice. in animals followed for 2 wk nearly 80% of injected radioactivity was excreted in the urine, indicating that in obstructive jaundice the kidney takes over entirely from the liver the function of bilirubin excretion.",med

794,"3446. effect of nicl2 on an isolated ranvier node an attempt was made to explain the extreme prolongation of the nodal potential by 0.1-1.0 mm nicl2 in terms of the ionic theory. the effects of nicl2 at room temperature are similar to those of temperature reduction decreased maximum rate of rise of the action potential, lengthened action potential duration, elevated threshold, increased tendency for repetitive activity; in addition, the amplitude of the action potential is slightly increased. the long-lasting plateaus of the responses obtained under the combined influence of nicl2 and temperature reduction are shortened by cathodal polarization, strong anodal polarization and decrease of (na)0. the plateau can be prematurely terminated by short anodal pulses of critical amplitude; short cathodal pulses reduce the duration of the plateau gradually with increasing pulse strength. increased (k)0 prolongs plateau duration; the steep repolarization phase which normally terminates the plateau is replaced by a long lasting after-depolarization with stepwise potential decline. the amplitude of k-depolarization is not influenced by nicl2 or temperature reduction. 1.0 mm nicl2 changes the relation between maximum rate of rise and steady-state polarization; the potential change required for 50% sodium inactivation is +8mv in normal ringer's solution and +16mv in the presence of 1.0 mm nicl2 (22 c.). 1.0 mm nicl2 increases the time constant of delayed rectification as measured in na-poor solutions at 4 c. by a factor of about 2. the decrease of action potential under cathodal polarization is slightly delayed by nicl2. it is concluded that prolongation of the nodal action potential by nicl2 is due to delayed and reduced inactivation of na permeability and delayed increase of k permeability; part of the nicl2-effect could be explained by assuming competition between ni++ and ca++ for specific sites at the membrane.",med

839,"Utility of Automatic Classification Systems for Information Storage and Retrieval Large-scale, on-line information storage and retrieval systems pose numerous problems above those encountered by smaller systems.. The more critical of these problems involve: degree of automation, flexibility, browsability, storage space, and retrieval time.. A step toward the solution of these problems is presented here along with several demonstrations of feasibility and advantages.. The methodology on which this solution is based is that of a posteriori automatic classification of the document collection.. Feasibility is demonstrated by automatically classifying a file of 50,000 document descriptions.. The advantages of automatic classification are demonstrated by establishing methods for measuring the quality of classification systems and applying these measures to a number of different classification strategies.. By indexing the 50,000 documents by two independent methods, one manual and one automatic, it is shown that these advantages are not dependent upon the indexing method used.. It was found that among those automatic classification algorithms studied, one particular algorithm, CLASFY, consistently outperformed the others.. In addition, it was found that this algorithm produced classifications at least as good, with respect to the measured established in this dissertation, as the a priori, manual classification system currently in use with the aforementioned file.. The actual classification schedules produced by CLASFY in classifying a file of almost 50,000 document descriptions into 265 categories are included as an appendix to this dissertation..",cisi

(3) on the other hand, in the initial stages, amyloid fibrils cannot be seen in the 'lamina densa' of the basal membrane; they only appear on the epithelial and endo- thelial surfaces of the membrane. this suggests that amyloidosis represents an abnormal precipitate of extrinsic origin, rather than a transformation 'in situ' of the basal membrane.

When, in the early 1950's, various people, such as Taube and Mooers, proposed new techniques for indexing, the reaction from the traditionally-minded was such that it appeared there was to be a repetition of all the old arguments. In an editorial in American Documentation in 1955, Perry expressed a viewpoint, shared by many others, when he wrote: Cautious and searching evaluation of all experimental results is essential in rating the efficiency of documentation systems. May the age-old controversies that arose from the conventional concepts of classification not be reborn in the mechanized searching systems of the future. There is hope for the avoidance of such errors if we will but regard documentation systems as useful devices, the benefits of which must be determined, not by polemics, but by the intelligent measurement of such benefits in relation to needs and costs.

867,"the downstream influence of mass transfer at the nose of a slender cone . the downstream influence of mass transfer at the nose of a slender cone . the influence of localized mass transfer at the nose of a slender cone under hypersonic flow conditions has been studied by experimental and theoretical means . two gaseous coolants, nitrogen and helium, are injected through a porous plug subtending a half angle of 30 . the effect of the mass transfer on the shock shape, pressure distribution, heat transfer, and transition are investigated . the experimental work involved tests in the mach-number-8.0 tunnel at pibal . the theoretical analysis involved a study of the effect of mass transfer on the shock stand-off distance and leads to an inviscid-flow parameter permitting the experimentally determined shock shape and pressure distribution to be extrapolated to other than test conditions and to other coolant gases . there is obtained the maximum value of this parameter resulting in no significant alteration of the pressure distribution on the cone and thus defining the flows in which boundary-layer-type similarity applies . significant reductions in heat transfer are obtained with injection . indeed, with small amounts of helium injection the peak heating is found to occur downstream on the cone and to be an order of magnitude less than would occur at the stagnation point without mass transfer . with nitrogen early transition is found to occur, so that local heating rates are actually increased over those prevailing at the same reynolds number without injection .",cran
868,"insulin and protein metabolism the present status of protein synthesis within cells has been outlined. protein is formed in the absence of insulin; the net formation of protein is accelerated by insulin. the effects of insulin on protein metabolism take place independently of the transport of glucose or amino acids into the cell; of glycogen synthesis; and of the stimulation of high energy phosphate formation. in the case of protein metabolism, as in certain studies on the pathways of glucose and fat metabolism, these observations reveal striking intracellular effects of insulin in many tissues. within most tissues the effect of insulin appears to find expression predominantly at the microsomal level. incidentally, other hormones which affect protein metabolism such as growth or sex hormones appear to act at the microsomes. the fact that insulin exerts effects on protein metabolism at other intracellular sites as well as the above independent effects leads one to agree that its action consists of a stimulation of multiple, seemingly unrelated, metabolic events. the fact that an immediate effect of insulin on protein synthesis is independent of the immediate need for extracellular glucose or amino acids does not mean that the sustained functioning of cells is likewise independent. the biochemist is fully aware of metabolic defects in diabetes which are not altered by insulin in vitro, but which demand varying periods of pretreatment of the animal. it is also known that in diabetes some proteins (enzymes) may be deficient while others may be produced in excess in the absence of insulin. it is suggested that the physician desires at least two kinds of relation between these fundamental studies and his patients. one is the possible relation of a deficiency of insulin action to pathological processes in tissues which have not as yet been examined by the methods described. the other is the need for more accurate measurements of the metabolic disorder and its control than such things as urinary and blood glucose. in developing such future improvements, the place of insulin in protein biosynthesis must be kept in mind.",med

Like its two predecessors, this volume attempts to describe and evaluate the most significant work that has been reported in the field during the past year, with the ultimate aim of improving both our standards and our means of professional communication. The field of information science and technology continues to evolve and grow. As it does, new areas of interest emerge and established areas of interest change in importance. Accordingly, our pattern of coverage changes. The single chapter on Automation in Libraries and Information Centers, in Volume 2, has been expanded into two chapters, one covering automation of technical processes and the other covering document networks, and a new chapter has been added on information system applications in education. Such applications are important not just because they involve, in part, libraries and other information facilities but because they highlight innovative ideas and techniques that should be of value to anyone interested in the total communication process. At the same time, ""core"" chapters of the review are continued: information needs and uses; content analysis, specification, and control; file organization and search; publication and distribution techniques; automated language processing; man-machine communication; information system design and evaluation; and professional aspects of information science. These topics are of continuing and vital interest to our readers, and their annual literature is significant, large, and growing.",cisi

884,"Introduction to the ADI Annual Review Over the past 15 or 20 years, a new and growing field of inquiry has begun to take shape. This field, which will be referred to as ""Information Science and Technology,"" draws on fragments and fringes of a number of sciences, technologies, disciplines, arts, and practices. The element that provides whatever degree of cohesiveness now exists in the field is a shared deep concern with ""information"" - its generation, transformation, communication, storage, retrieval, and use. Because of the universality of information processes, and also because of the variety of backgrounds of those concerned with them, there is very little agreement about the boundaries of Information Science and Technology, or about its parentage, its essential nature, or its future. To put it simply, at the present time there is no clearly defined and well-understood field of Information Science and Technology. There is not, truth to tell, even clear agreement on what the word ""information"" itself means and particularly on whether it implies a creative act of the intellect or a commodity that can be embodied in documents, transported, and exchanged. Distressing as this ambiguity and lack of agreement may be, they need not and do no preclude a constructive review of topics of current interest to users, designers, and students of information systems and services.

(b) mebranous bodies that accu- mulate focally in myelinated fibers in a zone extending 2 to 3 mm distal to the crush. these appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum in which demonstrable acid phosphatase activity increases markedly within 2 hours after the nerve is crushed.

The SDC is making comparisons of the efficiency of various published indexes and other sources of scientific information and the first results of rigorously checked comparisons are becoming available for a case study on the subject of 'Computers Related to Mass Spectrometry'. This results from an extensive literature search prepared by combining and collating results of searches in twelve of the world's major indexes to chemistry and spectroscopy, including searches of SDC's own data bank files.

From a discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification.. Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates, and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given, and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form.. The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with complete flexibility..",cisi

Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.

1030,"Adopting the Library of Congress Classification System This manual is designed to make it possible for any library to change efficiently to the Library of Congress Classification system. Detailed procedures are outlined which may serve as exact models or as a series of suggested steps which have proven effective in actual use. Most of the text deals with the necessary criteria for effecting the planning, making the preparations, selecting the tools, and establishing the procedures which are essential for a reclassification project. Beyond this, considerable attention has been given to many of the problem areas of the LC Classification-series, biography, bibliography, law, PZ3 and PZ4. In addition, the literature Tables VIIIa and IXa, two of the most frequently used tables throughout the entire class system, have been thoroughly explained and their application illustrated by a series of comprehensive examples. Since the mechanics, production, and cost of catalogue card copy can significantly affect the flow of books to users, a chapter has been devoted to describing the use of Xerox copying machines in library operations. Finally, an annotated bibliography of books and articles judged to be helpful in deciding to reclassify is included for those readers who wish to delve more deeply into the tortuous and frustrating 50-year history of the concept of centralized cataloging and classification.

1033,"On the Inverse Relationship of Recall and Precision It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse relationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly not new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not- Only (high recall). However, it was one of the propositions arising from Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked. In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the simple hypothesis required modification. By the following year test results coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question, there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results of a number of different searches are averaged. This, it will be noted, has four qualifications to the basic statement.",cisi

1046,"Education and Training for Scientific and Technological Library and Information Work The exponential growth of the literature of science and technology is a phenomenon which scientists have been living with for the past 300 years. It is in the nature of such growth that its effect is recognized only slowly, but when a critical point is reached its consequences can be overwhelming. In science information this point has now been reached. To take but one field, chemistry, it took well over two centuries for the first million papers to be published, and over 30 years, from 1907 to 1938, for the first million to be abstracted in Chemical Abstracts. We are now at the stage where one million papers have been abstracted in a five-year period - 1962-1967 - and before 1975 the point will have been reached where one million papers, equal to the output of the whole pre-war generation of chemists, will be published and abstracted in a single year. The first scientific serial began publication in 1665. Some 290 years later, in 1956, the Science Museum Library was receiving 9,000 current scientific serials. Within only a further 11 years the National Lending Library for Science and Technology (N.L.L.) was receiving over three times this number. The growth in the use of scientific literature is no less spectacular. Thus, for example, in 1930 the number of loans by the Science Museum Library was 10,000. In 1967 the N.L.L., which had taken over the national lending function of the Science Museum Library, lent well over half-a-million items, a total exceeding that of all the loans by the Science Museum Library between 1929 and 1947 (a period which itself saw the discovery of nuclear fission and its application for peaceful uses, enormous progress in antibiotics, developments in synthetic materials and great advances in all branches of science and technology). There are some signs that the rate of increase implied in these examples may not be maintained, but any flattening-out that may develop will be at a very high level indeed.",cisi

Process emphasizes the flow of decisions and activities during weapons programs, including the actions, reactions, and interactions of government agencies and defense contractors. Economic Analysis indicates our concern with how these activities and relationships affect the quality, time, cost, and value outcomes of weapons programs. The principal objective of this volume is increased knowledge of these facets of weapons development and production. Such an objective classified the volume as a social science, rather than administrative study.

It takes no account of documents used outside the library, still less of information transferred orally from person to person. The library acts as a channel in only a proportion of the situations in which information is transferred. Taking technical information transfer as a whole, there is no doubt that this proportion is not the major one.

Because document retrieval is in part an information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes - but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material.. Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered around the design and operation of searching machinery.. Boundary conditions have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans.. We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and more mechanical..

1060,"The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about society. Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing wider. Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory. This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins. In some part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time to produce their new theories. Although the neglect of theory is scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact that American radicals are often more American than they know and may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the intangible outputs of theory. Again, part of their neglect of theoretical problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals have with the ""hippie"" contingent of their generation, whose more expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile ""hassles"" of intellectual confrontation. There is also a vocal minority who, as has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to reason.",cisi

1110,"A Fuzzy-Set-Theoretic Interpretation of Linguistic Hedges A basic idea suggested in this paper is that a linguistic hedge such as very, more or less, much, essentially, slightly, etc. may be viewed as an operator which acts on the fuzzy set representing the meaning of its operand.. For example, in the case of the composite term very tall man, the operator very acts on the fuzzy meaning of the term tall man.. To represent a hedge as an operator, it is convenient to define several elementary operations on fuzzy sets from which more complicated operations may be built up by combination or composition.. In this way, an approximate representation for a hedge can be expressed in terms of such operations as complementation, intersection, concentration, dilation, contrast intensification, fuzzification, accentuation, etc.. Two categories of hedges are considered.. In the case of hedges of Type I, e.g., very, much, more or less, slightly, etc., the hedge can be approximated by an operator acting on a single fuzzy set.. In the case of hedges of Type II, e.g., technically, essentially, practically, etc., the effect of the hedge is more complicated, requiring a description of the manner in which the components of its operand are modified.. If, in addition, the characterization of a hedge requires a consideration of a metric or proximity relation in the space of its operand, then the hedge is said to be of Type IP or IIP, depending on whether it falls into category I or II.. The approach is illustrated by constructing operator representations for several relatively simple hedges such as very, more or less, much, slightly, etc.. More complicated hedges whose effect is strongly context-dependent, require the use of a fuzzy-algorithmic mode of characterization which is more qualitative in nature than the approach described in the present paper..",cisi

For two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major philosophical problem. Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally ignored by philosophers. At the present time there exist powerful technical models of classification and highly developed classifications of various branches of knowledge. What is lacking is a satisfactory general classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical problems underlying such classification. The need for clarification is important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of knowledge. It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.",cisi

The present note is divided into three parts: the first questions Palermo's assertion that the transition from introspectionism to behaviorism was a standard Kuhnian paradigm-change; the second, closely tied to the first, challenges the assumption that behaviorism itself can really be seen as a Kuhnian paradigm; finally, the third supports Palermo's thesis that behaviorism is in a 'crisis-state' but advances an alternative account of the reasons for this.",cisi

In our evaluation, two measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an estimate of the recall ratio.. To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted below..

It has been found that all the concepts present in any compound subject can be handled as though they belong to one of two basic concept types, using either Entitles or Attributes.. In classing, these concepts are identified, and notation is selected from appropriate schedules..

We now report the outcome of an attempt to create 'maps' of the scientific literature. The scales of these maps have been systematically manipulated so that they present, not only an overview of all highly-cited papers in natural science, but also a detailed view of a single scientific specialty. At each level we have systematically sought indications of the validity of the mapping operation, and have indications that the maps display at least certain important aspects of the specialty structure of science.",cisi

This research indicates that these models do not meet with important practical requirements. For example, many authors recommend a multiplicative index, over an additive index, in order to generate a wide range of project scores. The additive index is shown to have important advantages over the multiplicative index. The most serious shortcoming in the models, however, is the relatively arbitrary fashion in which the models have been constructed and the failure of the model builders to recognize the impact of certain structural considerations on resulting project scores. Comparative analyses relating project rankings produced by scoring models to rankings produced by a profitability index and by a linear programming model demonstrate that the performance of the scoring model is highly sensitive to decisions made during the development of the model. Considerations such as (1) the underlying distributions of project data, (2) time preferences, (3) the number of ranking intervals or categories, and (4) the width of the intervals, all have important implications for final project scores and associated rankings.",cisi

While it has long been recognised that only a proportion of the stock of academic libraries is actively used academic library buildings grow both more expensive and approach capacity fullness with remarkable speed. In certain cases some new buildings are full even before they have left the design-board stage. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion reached by R.B. Morris in 1963 that 'in terms of long range perspective, responsible judgement suggests that there is no feasible choice before libraries other than a wide and continuous programme of ""selective book retirement""'. Library stock control has not received the attention it merits from librarians whose energy, time and resources have been more than fully committed by the problems of acquisition and the provision of an ever-increasing range of services for readers. Early investigations of this issue have tended to be theoretical and Carol Seymour in her review ""Weeding the Collection"" put forward the view that ""a librarian should be able to begin his plan for weeding even if the day seems far off when weeding will be necessary... He also knows the sorts of information tools he will need to have at hand when the day does dawn on his overgrown garden"".

Moreover, a hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem into the structure and vocabulary of the system..",cisi

A simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet the needs of its users'. In fact, the definition of objectives in any service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step to determining policy. Since a complete state-of-the-art in user behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to drawing together some threads of research of potential application in university libraries. Methodological problems are not discussed here, since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere.",cisi
1317,"1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilis the role of the inducer, l-histidine, in the synthesis of histidase (l-histidine am- monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated. it was found that induced cells poisoned with actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis, lose their capacity for the forma- tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a rate which is independent of the presence or absence of the inducer. these results show that the inducer does not increase the intracellular level of histidase-specific messenger rna by preventing the des- truction of the major portion of this material, the fraction that is engaged in pro- tein synthesis. the possibility has not been excluded that the inducer exerts its effect by bringing about the stabilization of the messenger rna that is still attached to dna or has not yet become attached to ribosomes. alternatively, the inducer may actually stimulate the synthesis of histidase-specific messenger rna. the conver- sion of the precursor to active enzyme appears to involve polymerization of mono- mers, rather than the release of ribosome-bound inactive enzyme.",med

Our fundamental concern, however, was to discover whether the cybernetic ideas have any relevance for psychology. The men who have pioneered in this area have been remarkably innocent about psychology - the creatures whose behavior they want to simulate often seem more like a mathematician's dream than like living animals. But in spite of all the evidence, we refused to believe that ignorance of psychology is a cybernetic prerequisite or even an advantage.

1353,"functional craniology: an aid in interpreting roentgenograms of the skull analysis of the form of the skull is facilitated by considering it to be composed of a number of functional components. for the roentgenologist's purposes, division into the facial or somatic skeleton and the neu- ral skeleton is valuable, as is the recognition of three functionally separate portions within each calvarial bone: the inner table, the diploe and the outer table. the base of the skull is the only por- tion that is preformed in cartilage. this ac- counts for the unusual appearance of the skull in achondroplasia. in addition, the base apparently is more closely related to facial and general somatic growth than to neural growth. calvarial bone forms directly from membrane within the cerebral capsule. consequently, the size and shape of the cal- varia directly reflect the form of the grow- ing neural mass. the inner table of the calvaria at all ages is intimately related to the dura mater and directly reflects the form of the dura mater. consequently, the inner table re- flects the form of the arachnoid mater and, usually, of the brain as well. the outer table of the calvaria serves not only to protect the brain but also to anchor many of the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the skull. its form, particularly in thick-skulled mammals such as the pig, is determined more by the demands of these muscles and of the scalp than by the form of the brain. the principal function of the diploe is to form a lightweight yet rigid separation of the two osseous tables. in addition, it serves as a site of hematopoiesis; for this reason it may tend to a specific volume at a given age. the calvarial sutures oppose separa- tion of the bones of the calvaria while al- lowing relative motion between them. when the calvarial bones are passively car- ried apart with the expanding cerebral cap- sule by the growth of the neural mass, their areas are increased by the deposition of bone in the suture margins. the sutures, however, do not function as epiphyses and have no innate growth potential: removal of a suture does not disturb final skull form. because the calvaria represents ossi- fication of the cerebral capsule, it is small when the neural mass is small. the de- formity of the skull and the secondary changes that occur in the air sinuses and the diploe can be explained in terms of the functional cranial components. the op- posite changes occur when the neural mass is abnormally large. the correlation between skull size and intelligence is only fair. the presence of a brain of distinctly abnormal size, however, may be inferred from plain roentgeno- grams of the skull. premature closure of the cranial su- tures may be due to an abnormal form of the cranial base and possibly of the primi- tive chondrocranium that precedes it. the abnormality is mediated through the dural fiber tracts that underlie the major cal- varial sutures.",med

Externally, the cost of solid-state electronic devices has decreased almost as dramatically as their size. This has stimulated the development of digital computers and peripheral devices and this, in turn, has caused a dramatic increase in the volume of data communicated between such machines.

(1964) have also isolated from parathyroid extracts a protein that is inert in vivo but stimulates mitochondrial transport of phosphate in vitro. they postulated that this protein might be yet another biologically important factor produced by para- thyroid glands. the latter speculation may not be warranted in view of the uncertain specificity of protein effects on mitochondria. all of our tests completed to date show that the non-hormonal parathyroid proteins c1 and c2 are unrelated either biologically, immunologically, or chemically (by amino-acid analysis) to the parathyroid hormone. further rigorous studies are necessary to precisely determine whether any effects of parathyroid hormone on mitochondria validly reflect the mechanism of action of the hormone and whether it is sound to use the in vitro tests as bioassay tools.",med

Assuming that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of particular classes and their relations.

It recommends the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..",cisi

The primary test data are summarized as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents.. A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library, as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables can be calculated easily from the capability measures and the status statistics..

1477,"A Regional Network - Ohio college Library Center The Ohio College Library Center is developing a computerized, user-oriented, library system that will improve efficiency of library use and operations; that will increase availability of library resources within a region; and that will facilitate evolution of new and easier accesses to information in libraries. The center does not conceive of its task as being merely the mechanization of library procedures of the past. For the immediate future, the principal academic objective of the center is to increase the availability of library resources for use in educational and research programs in colleges and universities throughout Ohio. A more distant objective is to enable libraries to participate actively in the programs of instruction and research in their institutions. The passive service functions that libraries have developed during the past century are proving inadequate to meet the present demands made of libraries, and will be increasingly inadequate in the future. The per-student costs of libraries are rising somewhat more than twice as rapidly as unit-cost rises in the general economy. Therefore, the principal economic goal of the Ohio College Library Center is to decelerate the rate of rise of per-student costs, so that the rate of increase will approximate that of the economy as a whole.",cisi

1480,"Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA During the past year we have been one of the organizations participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical- Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness. For some time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index. These three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current awareness service. CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved. CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for computer search. The computer can also search for molecular formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all compounds included in the abstracts. ASCA in its original form was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers citing this work. Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore analogous to a CT search. This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of this type.",cisi

1484,"1688. surface phenomena in lungs in health and disease in summary, the authors have attempted to bring together the multiple observations which seem germane to the understanding of surface phenomena in lungs in health and disease. to this end, the contributions of anatomists and pathologists on the fine structure of alveolar cells and their lining are fundamental. the concepts of alveolar stability required the special insights of physiologists who were concerned with the causes of bubble stability as they related to the particular problems posed by a lung of several millions of bubbles arranged in parallel. soon the contributions of the chemists became significant as methods of identification and assay of the al- veolar lining material were of interest. clinicians asked what relevance these studies had to atelectasis as it occurs in disease, and soon the question of when the surfac- tant appeared in development occurred to those concerned with premature infants. students of metabolism began to focus on the lung as a site of phospholipid synthesis, and their tools seem most promising at this time in unearthing possible errors in metabolism which may express themselves in disease. surgeons who undertake per- fusion of the isolated lung ask the requirements of that organ with respect to the nutrients and environment of the alveolar cells, and anesthesiologists inquire into the possibilities of mechanical injury to the alveoli during artificial respiration. the problems posed to the reviewers of a subject which touches so many disciplines are obvious. doubtless some pertinent studies have been omitted although uninten- tionally; others may have been misinterpreted through lack of qualifications as spe- cialists in all specialties. the authors hope they have provided evidence that the forces of surface tension cannot be ignored in an organ with an air-liquid interface of some 70 m2. they further hope they have described some of the properties of the film at the alveolar-air interface which operate to produce stability of the alveoli. they hold the belief that study of the metabolism of the alveolar lining layer will further their understanding of a number of disease processes in which it may be altered. and lastly, they hope for much closer communication between workers in many disciplines who can elucidate this remarkable subject best through cooperative studies.",med

From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed.. Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff, than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, or computer programming.. The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to show the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads..",cisi

1518,"Library Networks The combination of computers and communications technology is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S. And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more effective ways. It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the library's function is to parcel out information, and that information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can be mailed. In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts, state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes Xerox and International Business Machines. Their initial efforts are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions. The Ohio college Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely copied by the others.",cisi
1519,"Some Remarks on Elitism in Information and the Invisible College Phenomenon in Science Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins' Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which contained absolutely no information on that subject. The technique used, we are told with a nudge of superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to combine the information. I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific Information is just some special variety of information that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate, pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828. We suppose too that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be full of scientific books, and that the best possible technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a library qualification and combined it with the appropriate sort of technical qualification. There is, as they used to say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical compound. I wish to point out two simple facts: there is more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage and retrieval of information, and there is about science and technology something intrinsically different from mere scholarship.",cisi
1520,"1209. the theory and practice of the family diagnostic. ii. theoretical aspects and resident education family intervention and observation have proved useful in 3 areas. the 1st of these is observation of the psychosocial context in the patient. on admission to a mental hospital the phenomenon of extrusion and separ- ation from the family is evident, and the need for study of the interaction between the patient and his family milieu is vital. the 2nd area where the family inter- view has a major role is resident education. the tra- ditional medical education of the ill prepares the stu- dent for consideration of the multifactorial problems of emotional disorder in which balances between mem- bers of a group may be the issue rather than external pathogenes. the family interview offers a unique point of observation of factually evident and emotionally con- vincing group data. in addition to the observation of family phenomena, mutual understanding of others' problems is created. finally, the family interview serves as an instrument for data collection and hypo- thesis seeking in relating individual psychopathology to family adaptations. the patient and his family at the time of admission are dealing with a crisis. some- times this is traumatic, such as the unexpected loss of a young marital partner, an unexpected illness, or a financial reverse. more commonly, however, it is developmental being a natural part of the life cycle. characteristically, the developmental task involved in dealing with the crises has been postponed so that one does not see the family at the age specific and ap- propriate time for this task. the crisis emerges dis- ruptively because of inevitable biological maturation, personal decision, or social expectation. a primary concern of the leader is to determine what life task is being faced. families have a mentally ill member not merely because they are dealing with the vicissitudes of life. they are unable to cope with the crisis, be- cause of the feelings which are aroused. each life cri- sis leads to a particular constellation of effects in any given family. these include primarily, sadness, anger, and guilt, but there may well be specific affective con- stellations appropriate to different developmental tasks. the patient's inability to cope with a life crisis is due to his particular adaptation of a style of dealing with feelings that is employed by other members of the family.",med

1528,"scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments . scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds and methods for fixing transition in model experiments . the major scale effects at high subsonic and transonic speeds arise from differences between the conditions under which laminar and turbulent boundary layers separate, and in how they behave after separation . for turbulent boundary layers, these conditions and behaviour do not vary greatly as the reynolds number is changed and in many examples, it has been shown that they are similar for the turbulent layers that occur naturally at high reynolds number and for boundary layers in which transition to turbulent flow is fixed artificially . the scale effects arising in wind-tunnel tests made at low reynolds number may, therefore, often be minimised by fixing transition to turbulent flow by introducing an artificial disturbance such as that produced by excrescences attached to the surface . the fact that the effects of separation are often less severe for laminar layers than for the turbulent layers that are likely to be encountered at full scale, makes it all the more important to do this whenever possible . several methods which can be used to fix transition are described, and the results obtained by using them are compared . in general, in experiments in two-dimensional flow, good agreement is found, and explanations can be advanced for cases in which discrepancies occur . several uncertainties and difficulties that arise in fixing transition are discussed and illustrated by examples . in particular, special care is needed in interpreting the results obtained with transition fixed at very low reynolds numbers (say, less than about r = 1 x 10 based on local chord for wings of about 0.1 thickness chord ratio and possibly higher reynolds numbers for thinner wings) . the difficulties of fixing transition satisfactorily are increased for three-dimensional wings, particularly if they are swept-back or highly tapered (i.e., small chord and reynolds number near the tip) and if the tests cover a large range of incidence including high incidences for which the flow may separate from very close to the leading edge . under these circumstances, it is frequently necessary to place the excrescences at different chordwise positions for low and high angles of incidence, and this is inconvenient in practice . more research is needed before sound recommendations can be made as to how and where transition should be fixed on such models, particularly since in routine testing, it is often not possible to check the effects of transition-fixing fully . in the sections dealing with three-dimensional tests, examples are given of the spurious results that have been avoided successfully by fixing transition, of the conditions where even at low reynolds numbers artificial fixing of transition may not be necessary to give a turbulent boundary layer ahead of the shock, and of the conditions under which there are some doubts whether the methods used for fixing transition have been satisfactory .",cran

Relevance is considered as a measure of the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge.. Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different points in the process of knowledge communication..

1558,"Productivity Differences among Scientists: Evidence for Accumulative Advantage The highly skewed distributions of productivity among scientists can be partly explained by a process of accumulative advantage.. Because of feedback through recognition and resources, highly productive scientists maintain or increase their productivity, while scientists who produce very little produce even less later on.. A major implication of accumulative advantage is that the distribution of productivity becomes increasingly unequal as a cohort of scientists ages.. Cross-sectional survey data support this hypothesis for chemists, physicists, and mathematicians, who show strong linear increases in inequality with increasing career age.. This increase is highly associated with a changing distribution of time spent on research.. Another implication of accumulative advantage is also corroborated: the association among productivity, resources and esteem increases as career age increases..",cisi

1593,"hypopituitarism: a study of growth hormone and other endocrine functions. pituitary function was evaluated in 25 adults with evidence of hypopituitarism or enlargement of the sella turcica. growth hormone secretory function was measured by radioimmunoassay of plasma samples taken before and after insulin-induced hypoglycemia in a standardized test of growth hormone reserve. all patients exhibited significant defects in growth hormone secretion, as indicated by the failure of this hormone to rise to normal levels in response to hypoglycemia. the order of frequency of hormonal loss was: growth hormone, gonadotropin, adrenocorticotropic hormone, thyroid stimulating hormone. no pattern of deficiency was characteristic for any particular etiology of hypopituitarism. one patient with asymptomatic enlargement of the sella turcica (accidentally discovered) had an isolated loss of growth hormone secretory capacity. two patients in the series demonstrated intrinsic deficiency of thyroid as well as pituitary secretion, and both had elevated liters of antithyroid antibodies. this study represents the first direct evaluation, by radioimmunoassay of growth hormone function in a series of hypopituitary adults. it demonstrates a remarkably high prevalence of growth hormone loss, and suggests that the growth hormone response to hypoglycemia may be one of the most sensitive tests for the diagnosis of hypopituitarism.",med

1601,"Targets for Research in Library Education Few librarians and library educators who criticize research relating to their fields realize in 1972 how far research has progressed during the last decade and a half. The criticism usually relates to the recognition that librarianship is more of a service and less of a fact- finding field of endeavor and that librarians are primarily trained to assist in the research activities of others rather than to conduct their own. One can add here that the average librarian who spends about forty hours a week on his job not always has the stamina to spend his free time on original research or the writing of proposals, which either are not adequately funded or are not published with the prominence hoped for. If the librarian-researcher commits his findings to writing, he is occasionally criticized for writing poorly or for having dwelled on topics of limited interest to the reviewer. Or he finds that while many praise his work there are no funds, possibilities, or opportunities to translate his conclusions into action.",cisi

Numerous studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.

He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly supported by the taxpayers' money. They represent a massive investment on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower. Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more than two hundred million pounds a year.

He declined to assess the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science would actually be transacted. It is these 'substantial changes' that concern the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become redundant. Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information. I regard the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to opportunity, not as an act of desperation. The big problem is to sort out what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change, select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of the scientist to this mass of information.",cisi

In my opinion the technical feasibility and merits of SDI have been adequately demonstrated; the main barriers hindering general use, however, tend to be of an economic nature. At Shell Research in Sittingbourne we have been operating, since 1967, an SDI service for the research staff and it has grown rapidly, particularly since we started to use the CA Condensates tapes early in 1969. In addition to these tapes we are currently using the BA Previews tapes, AGDOC tapes (prepared by ourselves using punched card input received from Derwent) and, on an experimental basis, Toxitapes, produced by BIOSIS, Philadelphia.

1655,"On Selecting A Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness Part II.

But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises the questions:	How can one decide which practical measure is likely to yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to these problems are taken up..

(b) chronic infection could readily be established by in vitro infection and no cytopathic effect was noted. (c) although many strains continued to shed virus throughout months of in vitro cultivation, no changes in growth properties occurred with the exception that infected strains from lung tissue showed limited growth capacities. (d) from observations of over 2,000 metaphases, neither obvious chromosomal rearrangements nor non-disjunctional changes were observed in strains infected naturally or experimentally. (e) among 17 rubella abortion-derived cell strains there was a marked elevation in frequency of chromosome breakage in 3 instances (18%, 29%, 68%,). (f) a correlation between virus shedding in vitro and increased chromosome breakage was noted although this was not complete. (g) the combined average frequency of chromosome breakage in one set of 7 rubella-abortion strains was 18%; in the other set of 9 abortus strains, 9.8%. (h) similarly, a slight, but significant elevation in average chromosome break frequency (9.8%) was obtained in four cell strains which had been experimentally infected in vitro with rubella virus (uninfected cells: 5.2%). although effects upon the chromosomes were demonstrated, these were restricted to slight general elevations in frequency of breakage above normal values. very high increases in breaks were sporadic. it appears more likely that the general fetal abnormalities associated with rubella infection in vivo result from possible effects of the virus upon growth rather than from effects upon the chromosomes. however, the studies were restricted to fibroblasts cultured in vitro; and effects on other types of cells may have greater implications for this question.",med

1675,"The Information Uses and Needs of Social Scientists: An Overview of INFROSS When INFROSS began in the autumn of 1967, although a large number of studies had been conducted into the requirements of scientists for information, very little had been done in the field of social science information. There are a number of possible reasons for this. Social scientists, faced with a much smaller total volume of information, were much less information-conscious and less inclined to seek for solutions. There are very few specialist libraries in the social sciences, and few librarians were therefore confronted with social scientists' information needs in the same way as librarians in scientific libraries were confronted with users and their problems. Finally, until OSTI came along there was little in the way of funds to support this kind of research. This almost total absence of previous research had its disadvantages and advantages. There were very few clues to guide us, and we were therefore working to a certain extent in the dark. On the other hand, we had a clean and open field uncorrupted by confusing and non-comparable studies. There is something to be said for being one of the first in a field.",cisi

1682,"Subject Analysis: Computer Implications of Rigorous Definator Subject analysis for information retrieval is an area which always seems deceptively simple to those without previous background in it, however extensive their background in specific subject disciplines may be. The basic requirement seems easy enough: to structure the statement of a subject in such a way that it can be placed into, and retrieved from, an ordered file. While attempts have been made to use simple, non-complex terms or even single words, it always becomes evident that single words are often insufficient to express a subject, and that some subjects are in themselves complex. To express such subjects requires either that their constituent concepts -- not words -- be separated and then recombined, or that only one part of the subject be shown. The former solution requires that the indexer perform the necessary analysis and synthesis, and then separate the constituents for the searcher to reassemble. The latter forces the seeker of information to sort through many items to find those bearing on the complex topic he wants, and ma require the indexer to decide under which part(s) of the concept an entry should be made.",cisi

Taking under consideration the study of ""Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries"" prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an international standard bibliographic description for monographic publications. There was common agreement that the objective was the development of specifications for the necessary data elements, their order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit them. These specifications should be designed to satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and, with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable, the needs of the libraries of the entire world. It was further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions were to be made quite independently of the heading under which they might appear in listings. The working group succeeded in its task and brought forth its provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard edition was published earlier this year. The success of this standard is manifested by the continuing increase in the number of countries that have adopted it.",cisi

Information centers are springing up across the country. Federal agencies and private groups are both collaborating and competing to establish comprehensive systems. Changing the library's name to ""information center"" is more than linguistic faddism. New, active roles subordinate the library's traditional, passive role as a preserver and codifier of knowledge. ""Information center"" bears analogy to ""economic center"" and ""transportation center."" Like these centers, its significance is in transaction. The significance of a transportation center lies in routes to other centers. The significance of an information center lies in communication lines to knowledge producers and knowledge users.

1787,"interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . interaction between shock waves and boundary layers, with a note on the effects of the interaction of the performance of supersonic intakes . the interaction between shock waves and boundary layers has important effects in many problems of high-speed flow . this paper has been written as a guide to the literature on the subject, and as a critical review of the present state of knowledge concerning both the underlying physical processes and the practical applications . it will be clear to the reader that, although substantial progress has been made, our knowledge is still far from complete and that more work both of a fundamental nature and on specific applications is needed before the problem is understood sufficiently well for design purposes . part i of the paper describes experiments on comparatively simple types of flow designed to provide fundamental information and to assist in the development of the theory . these experiments show that the interaction depends mainly on the mach and reynolds numbers and on the strength of the shock wave . in particular, the interaction of a shock wave with a laminar boundary layer is shown to produce much larger effects than if the boundary layer is turbulent . for most cases where the effects of the interaction are large enough to have serious practical consequences it is found that the boundary layer separates from the surface, and the difference between the interaction with laminar and turbulent layers arises mainly because the laminar layer separates much more readily in an adverse pressure gradient . the details of the interaction downstream of the separation point thus depend critically on the behaviour of the separated layer, and on the conditions under which it reattaches to the surface . many of the features found in the fundamental experiments appear also in practical applications and these are considered in parts ii and iii of the paper . although the emphasis hero is on the performance of aerfoils and wings moving at high subsonic speeds, the importance of the interaction in other examples such as at supersonic trailing edges and in supersonic intakes is also discussed briefly . the differences between the interaction with laminar and turbulent boundary layers are often a source of serious discrepancy between model experiments and full-scale conditions . for small-scale models it is, therefore, frequently essential to make the boundary layer turbulent by artificial means . some of the difficulties involved in doing this, and certain of the more promising methods are briefly discussed . it is shown that experiments on models with transition fixed can be used to explain a number of aerodynamic effects encountered in transonic flight, and connected with the occurrence of shock-induced separation of the turbulent boundary layers . for both two-dimensional aerofoils and straight and sweptback wings, turbulent separation occurs for shocks above a certain strength which applies for both model and full-scale conditions full-scale conditions,. differences in magnitude would be expected if the pressure recovery along the separated layer between the shock and the trailing edge is affected by reynolds number, but little information is at present available on this point . most of the repercussions of turbulent separation on the steady-motion characteristics of aerofoils and wings can be traced to the associated reduction in the pressure recovery over the roar of the surface . this is because the pressure at the trailing edge controls the inter-relation between the two surfaces /so long as the flow at the trailing edge remains subsonic/, and in particular the relative movements of the shock waves and the extents of the local regions of supersonic flow . certain unsteady-flow characteristics such as buffeting and control surface separation . some evidence is presented on the influence of section shape on the occurrence and effects of separation, but in this, as in many other respects, information relevant to turbulent boundary layers is scarce . some notes on the further work which is required are given in part iv of the paper .",cran

1791,"Inefficiency of the Use of Boolean Functions for Information Retrieval Systems In this note we attempt to point out why boolean functions are, in general, not applicable in information retrieval systems. First, we wish to stress that a system, which supposedly is to serve a certain purpose, has to try to optimize some overall performance rather than certain detailed parts of it. This situation is, of course, well known. Saying that a system should cater to an optimal performance implies that the reward varies with different circumstances. That is, there may always be some customers who will not agree that the system's output is satisfactory. However, these should be relatively few. In the case of an information retrieval system, let us consider one whose function is to furnish a reference list as a reaction to a question. So, if we have a set of documents S and a set of questions Q, the system has to assign to each question q, an answer A(q) which is a subset of S. Naturally, this answer cannot be chosen arbitrarily; it should reflect a relation between the question and the resulting reference list. Usually one says that the documents in the list are relevant to the question. More precisely stated, we assume that the enquirer expects a certain reference list, namely the one he would have procured had he himself probed the documents in the set.",cisi

1800,"numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking airfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with calculations for mach number 0.7 . numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking airfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with calculations for mach number 0.7 . the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatory indicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have been modified to include the noncirculatory lift associated with apparent-mass effects . although the apparent-mass effects are impulsive in nature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects in compressible flow is a time-dependent function . the corresponding reciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are given . by use of the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencing a sudden acquisition of vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7 . lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation of these functions at other mach numbers . although the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration of a sharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileron coefficients by a similar analysis, sufficient coefficients are not available at the present . however, an approximate method is shown for determining a portion of this unsteady-lift function . when a comparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbers appears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for the incompressible case . consequently, the calculation of the gust load factor at high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensional incompressible indicial lift functions and an over-all correction for compressibility such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative .",cran
1801,"various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow . various aerodynamic characteristics in hypersonic rarefied gas flow . this paper considers the problem of calculating viscous aerodynamic characteristics of blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds and at sufficiently high altitudes where the appropriate mean free path becomes too large for the use of familiar boundary-layer theory but not so large that free molecule concepts apply . results of an order-of-magnitude analysis are presented to define the regimes of rarefied gas flow and the limits of continuum theory . based on theoretical and experimental evidence, the complete navier-stokes equations are used as a model, except /very close/ to the free molecule condition . this model may not necessarily give the shock wave structure in detail but satisfies overall conservation laws and should give a reasonably accurate picture of all mean aerodynamic quantities . in this /intermediate/ regime there are two fundamental classes of problems .. a /viscous layer/ class and a /merged layer/ class, the latter corresponding to a larger degree of rarefaction . for the viscous layer class there is a thin shock wave, but the shock layer region between the shock and the body is fully viscous, although the viscous stresses and conductive heat transfer are small at the shock wave boundary . here, the use of the navier-stokes equations with outer boundary conditions given by the hugoniot relations is justified . for the merged layer class, the shock wave is no longer thin, and the navier-stokes equations can be used to give a solution which includes the shock structure and has free-stream conditions as outer boundary conditions . a simpler procedure is presented for /incipient merged/ conditions where the shock may no longer be considered an infinitesimally thin discontinuity but where it has not thickened sufficiently to entail the /fully merged layer/ analysis . in this case we approximate the shock by a discontinuity obeying conservation laws which include curvature effects, viscous stresses, and heat conduction . for a sphere and cylinder it is shown that the navier-stokes equations can be reduced to ordinary differential equations for both the viscous and merged layer class of problems . solutions of these equations, when used in connection with hypersonic flow problems, are in general only valid in the stagnation region . to illustrate the viscous layer solutions, numerical calculations have been performed for a sphere and cylinder with the assumption of constant density in the shock layer, which is a useful approximation at hypersonic speeds . to illustrate the merged layer solution, calculations have been carried out for a sphere using the incipient merged layer approximation . results are presented for detachment distance, surface shear, and heat-transfer rate in the stagnation region of a highly cooled sphere flying at hypersonic speed . with decreasing reynolds number, the shear and heat transfer are shown to increase above the extrapolated boundary-layer values in the viscous layer regime and then to begin falling in the incipient merged regime . as the reynolds number decreases in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer increases, and the static and stagnation enthalpy behind the shock decrease . calculations performed for an insulated sphere show that, with decreasing reynolds number in the incipient merged regime, the density in the shock layer decreases,. the total enthalpy behind the shock and at the stagnation point increase so that they are higher than the free-stream total enthalpy,. and the stagnation-point pressure behaves like the total enthalpy . for the highly cooled cylinder in the viscous layer regime, the same quantities are presented as for the sphere . the increase found in shear and heat transfer above extrapolated boundary-layer theory is small, in agreement with vorticity interaction theory . a discussion is given of the behavior of available experimental data for viscous flow quantities in the intermediate regime and the behavior predicted by the results of the present calculations . qualitative agreement is indicated .",cran

When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept of ""utility contours"" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p% library..

1816,"A Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge On almost all the occasions when we turn explicitly to the same problems, Sir Karl's view of science and my own are very nearly identical. We are both concerned with the dynamic process by which scientific knowledge is acquired rather than with the logical structure of the products of scientific research. Given that concern, both of us emphasize, as legitimate data the facts and also the spirit of actual scientific life, and both of us turn often to history to find them. From this pool of shared data, we draw many of the same conclusions. Both of us reject the view that science progresses by accretion; both emphasize instead the revolutionary process by which an older theory is rejected and replaced by an incompatible new one; and both deeply underscore the role played in this process by the older theory's occasional failure to meet challenges posed by logic, experiment, or observation. Finally, Sir Karl and I are united in opposition to a number of classical positivism's most characteristic theses. We both emphasize, for example, the intimate and inevitable entanglement of scientific observation with scientific theory; we are correspondingly sceptical of efforts to produce any neutral observation language; and we both insist that scientists may properly aim to invent theories that explain observed phenomena and that do so in terms of real objects, whatever the latter phrase may mean.",cisi

1839,"Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms. SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts' A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968.. Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA subject categories assigned to each item in NSA.. The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily.. In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%.. No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a lower precision.. A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made to identify reasons for failure..",cisi

1875,"Effectiveness of Combining Title Words and Index Terms in Machine Retrieval Searches Our experiment was based on volume 24 of Nuclear Science Abstracts (NSA) which contains about 53,000 citations; we used the generalized file-management system, Master Control, which can operate in either an inverted or a linear search mode. The inverted mode uses a table composed of the unique vocabulary contained in one or more data elements, along with all record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each vocabulary word occurs. For example, an inverted table constructed on titles will have one entry for each unique word of every title in the data base, plus the record numbers in which each word was found. (In Master Control, a word is defined as any set of characters bounded on either side by a legal separator such as a blank, period, comma, colon, etc.) On the other hand, in a linear search mode the data element is compared with the profile word, character by character, which results in a prohibitively time-consuming process for large data bases. We chose the inverted-table technique because of the large amount of data to be searched. Individual tables were constructed from the titles of the articles, NSA index terms, and titles and index terms combined. NSA index terms are controlled by the Euratom Thesaurus, as revised for NSA. We used two criteria in the study. First, the questions had to be of real interest to laboratory personnel. Some of the questions had actually been submitted by other members of the staff, to be run concurrently on the same data base on an SDI basis. The others were especially constructed by the authors for this experiment. Second, citations obtained were to be considered good (or relevant) only if they actually pertained to the subject in question; otherwise, they were to be considered ""false drops,"" regardless of the number of words matched between the profile and the citation.",cisi
1876,"Deterioration and Preservation of Library Materials The deterioration of library materials, constant since libraries began, has accelerated to alarming proportions in 1969. Researchers have predicted that all paper-based records of this century, as well as those of earlier years,face imminent ruin. Without new and effective efforts for their preservation, most will not be usable in their present form in the next century. The danger of destruction threatens not only research library collections but also the world of knowledge and scholarship that they support. For not only paper is involved. Similar dangers of destruction confront other cellulosic products, such as film, which may substitute for paper as the material base of records. And not only research libraries are involved. The surprisingly rapid deterioration of printed materials, even those that have been produced with some eye to permanence, creates problems and expenses for other libraries as well.",cisi

1883,"on early infantile psychosis. the symbiotic and autistic syndromes in conclusion, i wish to state that the core of child psychosis must be sought in one or the other of the described distortions of the sym- biotic phase. in the first case, what lay at the heart of the psychotic dis- turbance was the marked emotional unavailability of the mother, which alternated with a purely physical extreme closeness during the breast-feeding situations, and particularly with the destructiveness of the mother's unpredictable rage attacks. the contrasting experiences drove the child to the autistic warding off of any human contact and the de-animation of the world of reality. constitutional factors could not, in this case, be evaluated with any degree of accuracy. in the second case, it was, by contrast, the mother's ever-presence that created an unendurable instrusion upon and interference with the structuralization of the budding ego, which constitutionally and perhaps predispositionally may have been very vulnerable. this made it impossible for the infant to experience the normal alternation of the gratification-frustration sequences at his own pace; it also made the process of individuation in the separation-individuation period one which was beset with abysmal panic. in both instances, we can see that it was primarily in the severe dis- tortions of the normal symbiosis that the child psychosis had its roots.",med
1884,"An Experiment in Index Term Frequency This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its ""breadth"" as it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the ""optimal"" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same average breadth where one indexing consists of semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the other consists of merely ""reasonable"" index terms.. The result suggest that title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..",cisi

1893,"Library Cost Analysis: A Recipe Unforgivably, time has passed since the days when the library's patron was the local monarch and cost was no deterrent. Time's passage has replaced the monarch with taxpayers or stockholders, and, concurrently, sensitivity to cost has attained stellar importance. The causes for being unaware of costs may stem from a variety of reasons, but they cannot, in all fairness to the profession, belie an inability to perform the simple arithmetic of cost accounting. What is suspected is a lack of the few simple ground rules and the logical operations that bind them together, in short - a recipe for cost accounting and analysis. In the following is outlined one such set of ground rules and their related procedural requirements, which have evolved and been applied with success over the past few years. It is stressed that since this set represents the findings of one library, it may not fully satisfy the specific requirements of your own shop. Therefore, feel free to adopt the ground rules to your immediate requirements. With regard to discipline, it is pretty much summed up in the six steps and five resource requirements which follow. In addition to identifying steps, requirements, and the mysterious ways of cost analysis, these ingredients are blended together in a manner which will be meaningful for your internal operations and may be significant for your library's future.",cisi

In fact it appears that the use of the Science Museum's copy of a periodical is a rough measure of the national loan use of library copies.",cisi

I was impressed by the large amount of research being conducted in the field, but found the task of integrating that research and of identifying the progress made during the period of the review exceedingly difficult. In part, this difficulty was a result of the great differences among investigators in the phenomena they selected for study and the methods they used to study it. A more troublesome problem, however, was the apparent theoretical implications of their research. Concepts tended to be highly specific and inadequately defined. There was little standardization of terminology and little consideration for the nature of the processes underlying empirical data.",cisi
1932,"Some Aspects of Developing and Studying a Descriptor Information Language for General Technology The methods and results of an endeavor to develop an information retrieval language for automatic retrieval systems meant for handling a polytechnical document collection are described.. The descriptor dictionary includes general and special terms, both single-word and phrase terms, which is conducive to higher recall and relevance; it comprises a classified index and a lexico-semantic index as well as tables of generic relations.. The size of the dictionary is 5,542 descriptors and 3,073 keywords.. The indexing procedure includes: analysis of document content and its characterization by keywords elicited from natural text; and creation of the search pattern using the descriptor dictionary.. The techniques are described which are applied to analyze the documents into semantic aspects that constitute the elements of the formalized model of a document's condensed content.. The procedure employed to translate a text into the retrieval language comprises selection of words both from the title and the body of the document.. Main principles for retrieval efficiency determination using mathematical-statistic methods are given.. Tests on multi-subject collections show a probability of 85-% recall and 70-% relevance at a standard deviation of 25%.. These findings have been corroborated by the results of the basic experiment on a file of up to 2,500 search patterns using 42 requests.. Among the factors of losses there are the poor quality of abstracts (into cards) and the absence of a single abstracting procedure; it is proposed that abstractors should be in future charged with writing abstracts in keywords and, ultimately, in the descriptor language.. The experimental results attest to the feasibility and practical sensibility of creating a multi-disciplinary information retrieval system to be based on a broad-scope descriptor dictionary and on the suggested methods for document and request indexing..",cisi

1934,"The identification of variable-length, equifrequent character strings in a natural language data base The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank- frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization of storage because of the distribution characteristics.. An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in dictionary look-up times and storage utilization.",cisi

One hundred and forty judges rated each of nine abstracts for relevance to several short information requirement statements.. The some judges then repeated the ratings, each adopting (assuming) one of the fourteen use orientations described to them.. It was found that the particular use orientation assumed by the judge has a marked effect on relevance judgements.. It was also found that implicit use orientations can be analysed in terms of their underlying structure and that their study offers the possibility of discovering the conditions under which one person can accurately simulate and use the implicit use orientations of another.. Relevance judgements have been used as a basis of measures designed to evaluate the effectiveness of information retrieval system..

1953,"1747. the problem of albuminoid albuminoid is the main constituent of the insoluble fraction of the lens proteins. albuminoid from the cortex of ox lens has been fractionated on deae-cellulose in 7 m urea; peptide maps of the fractions are very similar to those from the corre- sponding fractions from a-crystallin. albuminoid can be regarded as an insoluble a-crystallin. an undiluted ground lens is clear but becomes turbid on dilution. if albuminoid is present in the normal lens, it does not cause turbidity even when the cellular structure is disrupted. it is perhaps more likely that the albuminoid is formed on dilution of the lens mush. the high concentration of proteins in the lens, especially in the nucleus, entails a high degree of order, which will be destroyed on dilution this phenomenon may well be connected with the precipitation of the albuminoid.",med

In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source, Destination, and Designation. ""Flow"" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common, forming a tetrad.

Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..",cisi
1993,"vibration isolation of aircraft power plants . vibration isolation of aircraft power plants . vibration in aircraft structure can almost always be traced to vibratory forces originating from the power plant . these forces are transmitted to the aircraft in two ways .. (1) by the action of air forces upon the surfaces of the aircraft in, or adjacent to, the slip stream of the propeller, and (2) by direct transmission of unbalanced forces from the power plant through the engine mounting . the latter has always caused the preponderance of disturbance . vibratory stresses induced in the engine mounting structure occasionally produce fatigue failures in the associated parts, and always shorten the useful life of the entire aircraft structure . more important, however, are the psychological and physiological effects of continuous vibration and its attendant noise on the passengers and crew . this may very likely be the major source of the rapid fatigue which is so intimately associated with flying . the importance and desirability of drastically reducing vibration can hardly be questioned . this paper is limited to a consideration of the directly transmitted forces and, further, considers the power plants as rigid bodies attached by flexible means to the aircraft which is also considered as a rigid body of relatively large mass . it is also limited to the case of engines and engine supporting structures having axial symmetry (radial engines), although the methods employed could easily be extended to other cases .",cran

(b) for the integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component that determines the critical point . the approach is justified by a study of the equations governing the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow problems for which closed form solutions are available . the range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by practical application and comparison with experiment,. results are presented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air stream at m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensional configuration at m = 8 .",cran
1995,"2406. profound hypothermia the aim of hypothermia is protection of vital cerebral structures from hypoxia during aneurysm repair; profound hypothermia is also valuable in operating on certain cardiac defects which cannot be repaired even with whole body perfusion. since the time needed for aneurysm repair often exceeded the safe limit of 8 to 12 minutes without circulation afforded by surface hypothermia of 29 to 30 c., the authors have investigated the drew (open-chest) technic, the closed-chest method, and isolated cerebral perfusion. the drew technic consists of substituting two pumps for the heart while the patient's lungs act as the oxygenator. because of its disadvantages (the large amounts of blood needed and the morbidity due to intra- cardiac cannulation and median sternotomy), a closed-chest method was developed, using a mayo-gibbons vertical-sheet pump-oxygenator to provide the perfusion and extracorporeal cooling without requiring thoracotomy. in cerebral perfusion, blood is taken from one artery, pumped through a heat exchanger, and returned to another artery. the authors describe anesthetic technics, offer comparisons of the three methods, give instructions pertaining to the production of hypothermia, and list the problems encountered in the management of these cases.",med

2007,"Text Searching Retrieval of Answer-Sentences and Other Answer-Passages Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, ""answer-passages"" are retrieved.. An ""answer-passage"" is a passage which is either answer-providing or ""answer-indicative,"" i.e., it permits inferring that the document containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages for screening retrieval output.. Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening ""syntactic joints"" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well.. The computer uses ""enclosure"" and ""connector words"" for determining when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers.. In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results.. The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a ""soft science,"" and it is reasonable to hope that in less ""soft"" sciences and technologies the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..",cisi

And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but added to it fundamental and constructive new elements. Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences. Such a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on documentation available. But his book gives us before all things an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts.",cisi
2033,"a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles . a comparative analysis of the performance of long range hypervelocity vehicles . long-range hypervelocity vehicles are studied in terms of their motion in powered flight, and their motion and aerodynamic heating in unpowered flight . powered flight is analyzed for an idealized propulsion system which rather closely approaches present-day rocket motors . unpowered flight is characterized by a return to earth along a ballistic, skip, or glide trajectory . only those trajectories are treated which yield the maximum range for a given velocity at the end of powered flight . aerodynamic heating is treated in a manner similar to that employed previously by the senior authors in studying ballistic missiles (naca tn 4047), with the exception that radiant as well as convective heat transfer is considered in connection with glide and skip vehicles . the ballistic vehicle is found to be the least efficient of the several types studied in the sense that it generally requires the highest velocity at the end of powered flight in order to attain a given range . this disadvantage may be offset, however, by reducing convective heat transfer to the re-entry body through the artifice of increasing pressure drag in relation to friction drag - that is, by using a blunt body . thus the kinetic energy required by the vehicle at the end of powered flight may be reduced by minimizing the mass of coolant material involved . the glide vehicle developing lift-drag ratios in the neighborhood of and greater than 4 is far superior to the ballistic vehicle in ability to convert velocity into range . it has the disadvantage of having far more heat convected to it,. however, it has the compensating advantage that this heat can in the main be radiated back to the atmosphere . consequently, the mass of coolant material may be kept relatively low . the skip vehicle developing lift-drag ratios from about 1 to 4 is found to be superior to comparable ballistic and glide vehicles in converting velocity into range . at lift-drag ratios below 1 it is found to be about equal to comparable ballistic vehicles while at lift-drag ratios",cran

The traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social and physical sciences. But we would do well to remind ourselves of the library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit in them.",cisi

2075,"Libraries and Neighborhood Information Centers It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link between community residents and social agencies. The major question is whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened social service bureaucracy. The rationale for envisioning the library in this role is twofold: (1) the library has achieved a reputation for impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and is not committed to any particular action program, community service or clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize, update and disseminate information.",cisi

2084,"On Aggression In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression in vertebrates. He points out that aggressivity is totally different from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often fatal attacks on the weaker mate. In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels. Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior, many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in animals. In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by a master of his subject.",cisi

Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow, the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance figures based upon the response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs, since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of underlying information needs..

The association measure, which is based on a priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are presented..

2157,"Patterns of Intellectual Influence in Scientific Research A widespread conception of the development of science holds that the great discoveries are a result of the cumulative work of a vast number of scientists.. Those historians and philosophers of science who express this point of view see the scientist who produces pedestrian research as an integral part of the developmental process.. The great men of science stand atop a pyramid of less distinguished and, to a large extent, invisible scientists.. An alternative hypothesis holds that relatively few scientists are responsible for advance in science and that, in the broader historical perspective, most of the eminent scientists, even of the calibre of Nobel laureates and National Academy members of today, are the ""pedestrians"" of history.. This paper attempts to put these conflicting ideas to empirical test for the field of physics.. Three independent sets of data are analyzed: one is drawn from a stratified random sample of American academic physicists, a second from a subjective evaluation of significant contributions to recent physics, a third from a set of papers cited in The Physical Review.. All three sets of data indicate that there is a sharp stratification in the use of work published by various types of scientists.. The data support the hypothesis that the physicists who produce important discoveries depend almost wholly on the research produced by a relatively small number of scientists.. The implications of these findings for the social structure of science are discussed and areas for necessary future research are suggested..",cisi

2197,"Measurement of Satisfaction in Work and Retirement The focus of the book can be summed up in its subtitle: A Strategy for the Study of Attitudes. This strategy is developed by devoting considerable attention to the nature of the concept of satisfaction, and, particularly, to the requirements for scientifically adequate measures of satisfaction. In fact, it is the emphasis on a comprehensive set of requirements for sound measurement, rather than on just one or two elements of it, which is the quality that sets this book apart from any previous report in the area of job satisfaction. Not the least of the values of this book is its basic utility for both academicians and practitioners. For the former, it should serve as a powerful spur and guide to further fundamental research on the nature and correlates of satisfaction. For too many years we in this area have been plagued by inadequately conceived and poorly developed measuring devices. This has led to a plethora of studies each using a different scale or measuring instrument. As a consequence, this has opened the door for almost anyone to claim the solution for making sense of the jigsaw pattern of findings relating to satisfaction. At the very least, the present volume should provide researchers with a thoroughly developed measuring instrument that will allow comparability of results across studies. If so, this may well bring some meaningful order to the present rather chaotically structured literature on job satisfaction.",cisi

Large and significant correlations with departmental prestige exist for measures of department size, research production, research opportunities, faculty background (including quality of PhD university), and faculty awards and offices.. Combinations of from six to nine indicators of these variables account for about three-fourths of the variance in departmental prestige; when other types of variables are held constant, indicators of all except research opportunities remain significantly associated with departmental prestige.. Correlations of prestige with rates of inbreeding and the proportion of foreign doctorates are discussed.. Differences in the correlates of prestige are small among the four fields studied..

Without pretending to exactness, we may divide dictionary catalogs into short-title, medium title, and full-title or bibliographic; typical examples of the three being, 1, the Boston Mercantile (1869) or the Cincinnati Public (1871); 2, the Boston Public (1861 and 1866), the Boston Athenaeum (1874-82); 3, the catalog now making by the Library of Congress.

2249,"A Core Medical Library for Practitioners in Community Hospitals In a ongoing study designed in part to evaluate and encourage continuing education programs in community hospitals Postgraduate Medical Institute (PMI) has determined that there is need for guidance in the area of medical-library development. Reports from PMI physician consultants who visited more than 40 community hospitals indicate that medical-library facilities are generally poor and infrequently used by physicians. The basic weaknesses of these libraries fall into four categories: inadequate collections, inadequate personnel, inadequate space, and the absence of any practical indexing system to facilitate use of collections that do exist. Failure to deal with these problems does not reflect lack of interest but rather lack of stimulation to do so and absence of any concerted source of guidance. In response to requests for such guidance PMI has undertaken a community hospital library development project in co-operation with the New England Regional Medical Library Service (NERMLS) at the Francis A. Countway Library of Medicine. This report is concerned with the first phase of this project - namely, the formulation of a list consisting of a minimal number of textbooks and journals that can function as the core for a medical library. Explanatory letters and questionnaires were sent to 400 specialists representing 50 areas of medical practice, including the basic sciences.

2257,"Algebraic Systems As far back as the 1920's, algebra had been accepted as the science studying the properties of sets on which there is defined a particular system of operations. However up until the forties the overwhelming majority of algebraists were investigating merely a few kinds of algebraic structures. These were primarily groups, rings and lattices. The first general theoretical work dealing with arbitrary sets with arbitrary operations is due to G. Birkhoff (1935). During these same years, A. Tarski published an important paper in which he formulated the basic principles of a theory of sets equipped with a system of relations. Such sets are now called models. In contrast to algebra, model theory made abundant use of the apparatus of mathematical logic. The possibility of making fruitful use of logic not only to study universal algebras but also the more classical parts of algebra such as group theory was discovered by the author in 1936. During the next twenty-five years, it gradually became clear that the theory of universal algebras and model theory are very intimately related despite a certain difference in the nature of their problems. And it is therefore meaningful to speak of a single theory of algebraic systems dealing with sets on which there is defined a series of operations and relations (algebraic systems). The formal apparatus of the theory is the language of the so-called applied predicate calculus. Thus the theory can be considered to border on logic and algebra.",cisi
2258,"Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach is described and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of effectiveness were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..",cisi

2269,"Science and Information Theory A new scientific theory has been born during the last few years, the theory of information. It immediately attracted a great deal of interest and has expanded very rapidly. This new theory was initially the result of a very practical and utilitarian discussion of certain basic problems: How is it possible to define the quantity of information contained in a message or telegram to be transmitted? How does one measure the amount of information communicated by a system of telegraphic signals? How does one compare these two qualities and discuss the efficiency for coding devices? All of these problems, and many similar ones, are of concern to the telecommunication engineer and can now be discussed quantitatively. From these discussions there emerged a new theory of both mathematical and practical character. This theory is based on probability considerations. Once stated in a precise way, it can be used for many fundamental scientific discussions. It enables one to solve the problem of Maxwell's demon and to show a very direct connection between information and entropy. The thermodynamic entropy measures the lack of information about a certain physical system. Whenever an experiment is performed in the laboratory, it is paid for by an increase of entropy, and a generalized Carnot Principle states that the price paid in increase of entropy must always be larger than the amount of information gained. Information corresponds to negative entropy, a quantity for which the author coined the word negentropy. The generalized Carnot Principle may also be called the negentropy principle of information. This principle imposes a new limitation on physical experiments and is independent of the well-known uncertainty relations of quantum mechanics.",cisi

A further eight bibliographies have been studied, and the results are reported here. Our results are presented below in the following form: 1. Title of bibliography, source, content (number of journal references, reports, etc.). 2. Abstracts journals consulted. 3. Coverage and multiple coverage. This is a bar-chart showing number of references not abstracted, those covered once, twice, and so on. 4. Coverage by each abstracts journal, given as a bar-chart, the last column showing coverage by all services combined. (Where bar-charts are given they show coverages as percentages of the whole bibliography, actual numbers of references being shown beneath the appropriate columns. 5.

2277,"Undergraduate Library The development of the separately housed undergraduate library on the modern university campus is a recent innovation - so recent, in fact, that in September, 1965, there were only six such libraries in the United States. The interest in effective undergraduate education which led to the creation of these libraries, however, is not of such recent origin. As early as 1608, when Thomas James was appointed to Bodley's Library, ""he proposed the establishment of an undergraduate library to help the younger student. But Sir Thomas Bodley was opposed."" So it is to Harvard that we turn for an example of the protracted concern for the undergraduate's plight. Despite the concern voiced by these earlier writers, most universities and their libraries were relatively small until this century. More important, they were largely undergraduate institutions. The great expansion of graduate education is a twentieth-century phenomenon. The problems of the undergraduate in using university collections were greatly compounded by the striking growth in the size of collections and by an increasing emphasis on the acquisition of materials suitable for research. The large university collections became increasingly difficult for the undergraduate to use. When he had to select his books from the card catalog and obtain them through paging in a closed-stack system, he might well abandon the attempt before finally locating a book which was not checked out, missing, or at the bindery - and which was suitable for his purposes. The university library was also difficult to use because it was crowded - study conditions were unsatisfactory and staff was insufficient to handle the volume of work.",cisi
2278,"Performance and Cost of ""Free-Text"" Search systems The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with citations relevant to his query. Since the user is the only person competent to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval error. The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures of performance, precision and recall. Precision measures the failure of the system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base. It is difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in being provided with irrelevant citations. From the user's point of view, therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a deficient system.",cisi

2296,"Library Education and the Public Library A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains for current service instead of educating for growth and change. Unfortunately, the picture many faculty members have of what today's requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete. Graduates are thus doubly handicapped. Not only do we fail to educate, we fail even to provide realistic training. At worst, we perpetuate the past and train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public libraries. Library education, like the public library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of oblivion. Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive. Others will wither away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies. There is no shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both. An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called ""Dust Gathers on the Public Library"" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is dead - while the public library lives on).",cisi

Government expenditures for research and development have increased from a modest annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today. The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today. These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results, ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics, but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one. The sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy. The value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased technical capability.

The rate at which innovations in information- handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer, but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.",cisi
2316,"Top Priority for Cataloging-In-Source After a century of public library service and progress, public libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information. But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city libraries show slight decreases in annual circulation, the major measure of their usefulness. Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last decade. Possibly because the number of public, college, university, and special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 (Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969). And there are more than that many school libraries.",cisi

2352,"The Development of a Semantic Differential to Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive Reference Retrieval System A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest.. To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system.. Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same 19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was labeled ""evaluative-specific"" and accounted for over 23% of the total variance.. Factor II was called ""desirability""; it accounted for over 17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled ""enormity"" accounted for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading.. In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions.. Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..

All too many librarians regard government documents and in particular, the documents of international agencies as esoteric, unlike the usual library materials in format and publication pattern, and as presenting problems of acquisitions, control and service so complex and so frustrating that they are best left to the specialist in documents. The result is that international documents are a puzzlement to the general librarian, and a source of frustration to the ill informed administrator; a situation exacerbated by the present general tendency of library school curricula to ignore the question of international documents except for cursory mention in one or at most two sessions of a general course in government documents to which relatively few students are exposed. The information in this volume will allay the fears of the generalist librarian. It also provides the data on which to base additional emphasis on international documents in the library school curriculum.",cisi

2387,"Mathematical Approach to the Spread of Scientific Ideas - The History of Mast Cell Research One of the most intriguing problems of modern science is the obscure nature of its own growth. Indeed, there are few notable scientists who have not, at one time or another, given serious thought to the questions of how their particular science has reached its present state and what will be the course of its future development. These questions seem to be of such importance to scientists that they have emerged as fundamental scientific problems in their own right. Goffman and Newill have pointed out that the process by which ideas spread within a population of scientists possesses epidemiological properties and can therefore be investigated as an epidemic process. Consequently, a new set of mathematical tools can be applied to the problem of explaining the nature of scientific development. In particular, this approach makes it possible to establish the relative importance of past lines of inquiry within a given area of scientific research, and to predict the future behavior of existing lines of investigation as well as the emergence of important new ones within the given area. The purpose of this communication is to demonstrate this method by applying it to the development of knowledge about mast cells. In his recent comprehensive survey of this subject, Prof. Hens Selye has assembled a ""full bibliography"" in which ""every aspect of the mast cell is dealt with.""

As a result a rapid and large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The consequent enormous growth of literature in the field has created great difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of presentation.. The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field..

Using the mail questionnaire, sociometric data on different types of scientific relationships were obtained from scientists, all of whom had published in a particular problem area.. Respondents chose scientists who had not published in the area as often as they chose scientists within the area.. Analysis of direct and indirect ties, using Cleman's method for analysis of sociometric connectedness, revealed that a tie with one or more of the highly productive scientists brought other scientists of less productivity into a large network of influence and communication.. Similarities between this type of social organization and that of the ""social circle"" are discussed..",cisi

2479,"an approximate solution of the compressible laminar boundary layer on a flat plate . an approximate solution of the compressible laminar boundary layer on a flat plate . following a major assumption that enthalpy and velocity are dependent only on local conditions, an enthalpy-velocity relation is obtained for the laminar boundary layer on a flat plate where subscripts p refer to the plate, 1 to the free stream and e to the equilibrium temperature condition at the plate . when compared with general results, this relation (exact for prandtl number o = 1) gives a close approximation to crocco's numerical results for o = 0.725 and 1.25, up to . using the above relation in conjunction with the approximate viscosity-temperature relation suggested by chapman and rubesin, and with young's suggested first approximation for shearing stress it is shown that close approximations to displacement thickness and velocity distribution are given by and where and which serves to define c . these have the advantage of being algebraic in form whereas previous results have involved complex numerical integrations for individual cases .",cran

2487,"Thesaurus Compilation Methods: A Literature Review This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific and Technical Information and the end product of the complete research will be a thesaurus of management terms. Parallel research in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School, and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of Business Studies. As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the construction of a faceted classification scheme for management, this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus. A study of existing information retrieval systems in the management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed. Thus a comparative study of other systems will not be attempted. A decision has also already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus, was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of natural language over controlled vocabularies. This was primarily because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of management. This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social science (20 per cent). Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov, Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.",cisi

2519,"2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animals the article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of available information on selenium toxicity in domestic animals. literature reveals evidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when given orally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts. there is also variation in toxicity of organic se analogs. when exposed to ruminal digestion, there is considerable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactive elemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as much as 40% of a single oral dose. fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium, cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity. arsenic and tungsten give some protection against it. bromobenzene, benzene, and napthalene mobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion. since se preparations designed for topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available for use in both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning from misuse of such preparations. selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeutic agent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic. however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritional and toxic doses of these salts.",med
2520,"propeller in yaw . propeller in yaw . it was realized as early as 1909 that a propeller in yaw develops a side force like that of a fin . in 1917, r. g. harris expressed this force in terms of the torque coefficient for the unyawed propeller . of several attempts to express the side force directly in terms of the shape of the blades, however, none has been completely satisfactory . an analysis that incorporates induction effects not adequately covered in previous work and that gives good agreement with experiment over a wide range of operating conditions is presented herein . the present analysis shows that the fin analogy may be extended to the form of the side-force expression and that the effective fin area may be taken as the projected side area of the propeller . the effective aspect ratio is of the order of 8 and the appropriate dynamic pressure is roughly that at the propeller disk as augmented by the inflow . the variation of the inflow velocity, for a fixed-pitch propeller, accounts for most of the variation of side force with advance-diameter ratio v nd . the propeller forces due to an angular velocity of pitch are also analyzed and are shown to be very small for the pitching velocities that may actually be realized in maneuvers, with the exception of the spin . further conclusions are .. a dual-rotating propeller in yaw develops up to one-third more side force than a single-rotating propeller . a yawed single-rotating propeller experiences a pitching moment in addition to the side force . the pitching moment is of the order of the moment produced by a force equal to the side force, acting at the end of a lever arm equal to the propeller radius . this cross-coupling between pitch and yaw is small but possibly not negligible . the formulas for propellers in yaw derived herein (with the exception of the compressibility correction) and a series of charts of the side-force derivative calculated therefrom have been presented without derivation in an earlier report .",cran

2560,"evaluation and treatment planning for autistic children infantile autism is considered to be a re- action on the part of an immature organism at a primitive and undifferentiated stage of ego development. little choice of defensive reactions is available; the possibility of sub- limation does not exist and, even though other object relationships are gradually developing, the mother is still the child's primary object. at this vulnerable develop- mental stage, a wide range of pathological circumstances, ranging from the most severe family psychopathology to the most adventi- tious physiological traumata or the most un- fortunately malignant circumstances, may constitute an acute or cumulative cata- strophic stress. the primitive organism tends to respond to this overwhelming stress with a paranoid reaction which is directed at the mother (regardless of the actual etiologi- cal variables) because the mother is still the child's primary object. we believe that the child then responds with an autistic reaction and shows varying degrees of simple with- drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de- lusional thought processes, and consequent disruption of developmental skills, speech, and relationships with others. many families can and do make every effort to counter the paranoid reaction of the child and do not respond to his rejection with counterrejection and counterwithdrawal. some of the child's autistic symptoms may abate without formal treatment. yet, since the mother (and family) are the primary objects of the child's paranoid attitude, it is felt that formal therapeutic intervention is necessary to modify the paranoid core of the autistic reaction.",med

A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many distinct user classes..",cisi

2599,"The Hidden Dimension Generally speaking, there are two types of books of interest to the serious reader today: those that are content oriented, designed to convey a particular body of knowledge, and those that deal with structure, the way in which events are organized. It is doubtful if an author has any control over which of these two types of books he writes, though it is desirable that he be aware of the difference. The same applies to the reader whose satisfaction depends largely on his unstated expectations. In today's world, when all of us are overwhelmed with data from many sources, it is easy to understand why people are apt to feel that they are losing touch with developments even in their own field. One senses that there is also a growing awareness of a loss of relatedness to the world at large. This loss of relatedness leads to an increased need for organizing frames of reference to aid in intergrating the mass of rapidly changing information with which man must cope. The Hidden Dimension attempts to provide just this.",cisi
2600,"Some User Requirements Stated Quantitatively in Terms of the 90 Percent Library Librarians, publishers, and information system engineers have very little verified information and few guidelines to describe the user's specific requirements for information. Such information is needed to properly design or evaluate the information systems. To date, most of the statements of requirements have been rather subjective, and often reflect opinion rather than actual fact. Relatively little objective data have been obtained. This is probably due in large part to the fact that there are extremely difficult methodological problems in trying to determine and state user requirements in a meaningful manner. This paper suggests an approach or point of view that might help this situation by providing a method of phrasing the statements of user requirements in a more convenient and meaningful manner. This paper also furnishes several examples of such statements, and discusses the techniques and data that support these statements. In this paper, attention is initially focused on the information requirements of workers in the field of science and technology, with no serious attempt made to include workers in other fields. However, it seems quite likely that the approach, and perhaps even the stated principles, could be extended and generalized to cover other fields of knowledge.",cisi

2607,"What Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective? Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword frequency..",cisi

2649,"Is Interindexer Consistency A Hobgoblin? It is often assumed that the amount of interindexer consistency experienced under a given method of indexing is somehow indicative of the quality of the indexing.. To explore this assumption, two hypotheses are stated concerning the possible connection between interindexer consistency and indexing quality.. A specific counter-example is then exhibited which shows both hypotheses to be invalid.. Although a mathematical analysis of the counterexample yields certain insights, the general relationship between interindexer consistency and successful retrieval is more subtle than might have been expected.. It is concluded that until equations describing this relationship have been derived, measurements of inter-indexer consistency will have little meaning as clues to indexing quality..",cisi
2650,"Adventures in Librarianship There has long been a need for a continuing series to provide scholarly reviews of the rapidly changing and advancing field of librarianship, a series which would select subjects with particular current significance to the profession and provide an analysis of the advances made through research and practice. Advances in Librarianship is planned and designed to fill this need. It will present critical articles and surveys based on the published literature, research in progress, and developments in libraries of all types. Mechanization may appear to be the most obvious of the advancing fronts of librarianship, for automation has caught the enthusiastic support of all librarians who can visualize its potential. Advances in this field will certainly be found in every volume of this series. As the first group of articles in this volume demonstrate, technological change has an obvious and direct implication for libraries, but the problem has been found to be much more complex than the simple inventory problem many experts expected. Advances in Librarianship is dedicated to presenting the realities of automation, assessing where we are, where we are going, and how fast we can hope to get there. ""The Machine and Cataloging"" reviews the current status of the machine-produced book catalog and what lies ahead as we enter the age of MARC. Where business methods have greater applicability, progress is easier, as reported in ""Mechanization of Acquisition Processes."" Even in this area generally acceptable practices and standardization are in the future, not the past. One of the problems of major and immediate importance in computerization of catalog information is that discussed in ""Filing Systems for Computer Manipulation."" This detailed review presents the complexity of the problems and suggests possible solutions. For many years technical service costs have been defended without adequate knowledge of the facts. As automated procedures are proposed, standards are determining costs of traditional operations become essential. The article on standards for such costs shows why the problems have been difficult and reviews the significant advances of the past few years. The school library has widened its dimensions in materials and services much more rapidly than other libraries, as reflected in its new name, the instructional media center. Here, technical change, together with new teaching methods, has made possible major developments in library service in schools as well as for children in the public library. Two articles make clear that what can be done has been demonstrated, and that what remains is to make this the rule rather than the exception. Bibliotherapy is an example of a field in which progress has been slow. Articles which illustrate the potential which systems theory and managerial planning theory have for libraries. The articles on the application of these concepts, which come from research in administration, are provocative and may appear controversial to some. The article on library development in developing countries provides an analysis in depth of our efforts and degree of success in assisting other countries in providing the library service which is so important in the modern world.",cisi

For purposes of comparison, the work of Patterson and Sheppard is represented in abbreviated form in Tables 1 and 2. The results of our own study are presented as Tables 3 and 4. The reader can draw several obvious conclusions. About half of all the citations in Tables 3 and 4 are to papers published in the 1950's. This, in part, reflects the present highly vigorous state of chemical investigation and its rapid expansion in recent years. Another striking fact is that in the Journal of the American Chemical Society, 39.5% of the citations are to previous work published in the journal itself. In Industrial and Engineering Chemistry, the percentage of self citations is 21.3. To some extent this may result from the fact that writers who habitually publish in a particular journal tend to cite their own work. However, it seems to reflect to a greater degree the dominance of these journals in their respective fields.

During the half century spanning 1900 the schools in many professions formed national associations. The Association of American Medical Colleges, for example, was established in 1876. Other professional school associations followed: engineering (1893), law (1900), librarianship (1915), theology (1918), and social work (1919).

2690,"Annual Reviews of Information Science and Technology The major trends of the 1970's in information system planning and services are becoming clear, as indicated in this year's Annual Review chapters. The movement toward inter-institutional operations, or networking, began gaining force in the 1965-1970 period, through the establishment of many new library consortia, and there were some tentative efforts to use computers for nationwide bibliographic information ""utilities."" These movements are now more vigorous and are showing signs of being cost-effective, productive ventures. Inter-institutional cooperation not only promises service improvements and cost reductions, but also poses new problems and demands. Formalized cooperation among different institutions requires agreement about needs and priorities and gives special importance to a clear understanding of the information needs of specific user subgroups. It also requires more careful and productive system planning and design, including intelligent consideration of the ""make versus buy"" issue. Several chapters in this volume touch on these problems and considerations. One of the most significant developments in 1973 was the rapid growth in the use of on-line information retrieval services - both those operated by the federal government and those operated by the private sector. The apparent cost-effectiveness of these services is raising some of the same problems for data base producers that inter-institutional cooperation among library and information facilities is raising for the publishers of printed materials: namely, how to cover rising costs in the face of declining (or less rapidly growing) sales of individual units of the product - monographs, serials, secondary information publications, or magnetic tapes. The inclusion of a chapter on copyright - the first in the Annual Review series - reflects the importance of this topic in the growing controversy over the ownership and distribution of information. Another aspect of that controversy - the role of government and non-profit information services in relation to those of private industry - is explored in this year's chapter on document retrieval systems and techniques.",cisi

The major elements determining whether or not libraries receive requests to borrow from libraries at a distance are whether the library lists unusual materials in union lists, especially THE NATIONAL UNION CATALOG, THE UNION LIST OF SERIALS AND NEW SERIAL TITLES, and whether it has strong collections in a subject field listed in library directories. Volume of out-of-state lending is related to the type of lending library, the size of collection, budget for current acquisitions, number of periodicals received, photocopy charges, population density in neighboring states, proximity to other libraries, and completeness of reporting holdings in the National Union Catalog or other bibliographic centers.",cisi

Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts, in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser Line Notations (WLN). Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in machine language. The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts. Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969. Since the tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems employing ""word"" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments. Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches which do not require computer manipulation.",cisi

The following recommendations are made for the guidance of authors and editors, so that abstracts in primary documents may be both helpful to their readers and reproducible with little or no change in secondary publications and services.. Prepare an abstract for every formal item in journals and proceedings, and for each separately published report, pamphlet, thesis, monograph, and patent.. Place the abstract as early as possible in the document.. Make the abstract as informative as the document will permit, so that readers may decide whether they need to read the entire document.. State the purpose, methods results, and conclusions presented in the document, either in that order or with initial emphasis on findings.. Make each abstract self-contained but concise; retain the basic information and tone of the original document.. Keep abstracts of most papers to fewer than 250 words, abstracts of reports and theses to fewer than 500 words (preferably on one page), and abstracts of short communications to fewer than 100 words.. Write most abstracts in a single paragraph.. Normally employ complete, connected sentences; active verbs; ad the third person.. Employ standard nomenclature, or define unfamiliar terms, abbreviations, and symbols the first time they occur in the abstract..",cisi

The average author set contained almost half of all the terms employed by more than one member of the user group and scored 73% of the maximal possible score, as compared with 44% for the average title set.. When judged by the method and criterion employed here, author indexing is substantially better than indexing derived from document titles..

Even though persons in physics, a field with high academic standing, decided to enter biology, which had a lower academic standing, and even though some recruiting of students occurred, these factors alone are not sufficient to account for the development of the specialty, particularly given the competitiveness of modern conditions.

2746,"Analysis and Organization of Knowledge for Retrieval In a university, the mode of research is usually what is called 'pure' or 'basic' research; since I am keeping in mind primarily the applications of information science, I will prefer the word 'basic', although there is not so much difference. In such research, and really in any good research, one should not be collecting data haphazardly. One must isolate and define a problem and, as far as possible, control other conditions so that interfering factors are eliminated. Preferably one will narrow down the problem to manageable proportions. It is then essential to approach the problem with some sort of hypothesis or theory of the situation, and to concentrate on obtaining evidence for or against that hypothesis. The important task is to devise just that crucial experiment which will give the answer as efficiently as possible. If the answer disproves the hypothesis, one has at least further evidence upon which to construct a different hypothesis; if it confirms the hypothesis, one is ready for a further step forward, and so on. Research is easier in a fully controlled and reproducible situation; in a biological or human situation one must often have recourse to statistical methods, but this does not alter the general methodology. On the whole, I find a clear methodology lacking in much that is being done in the field of information science today.",cisi

2760,"fetal and neonatal hepatitis and its consequences. the author reports on 18 fatal cases observed in infants from 3 weeks to 1 year old. in all cases, jaundice appeared just after birth or during the first days of life, and was persistent. the stools were sometimes discolored. there was no blood incompatibility. the picture was similar to that of congenital biliary atresia. pathological study revealed 2 groups: (1) with pathological changes of hepatitis (11 cases). the liver is enlarged, flabby and icteric. microscopy shows dissociation of the cell cords and polymorphism of the hepatic cells (necrotic cells, balloon cells, giant cell transformation). some of the giant cells show vacuoles, erythrocytes, lipids and acidophilic material in their cytoplasm. there are signs of regeneration, collapse of the stromal framework, proliferation of the mesenchymal cells and bile retention. cells of the erythrocytic series are scattered in the periportal spaces with eosinophilic leucocytes, lymphocytes and histiocytes. (2) with fibrosis and cirrhosis (7 cases). the liver is green, firm, with a nodular or granular surface. the extra-hepatic biliary tree is normal. the spleen is enlarged. microscopy shows bile stasis, pericholangiolitic fibrosis, and proliferation of bile ductules. the periportal, interlobular and intralobular fibrous tissue is increased, and shows cellular infiltrations. the architecture of the liver is disturbed by the presence of pseudolobuli in the regeneration areas. it is suggested that these cases are due to a congenital viral hepatitis, which is not only the result of an intrauterine infection, but also a feature of fetal hepatitis, with secondary pericholangiolitic or post-necrotic liver cirrhosis. the neonatal giant cell hepatitis is to be considered as the result of a cytotoxic action of the virus. the author considers also the possibility of a viral etiology in cases of biliary atresia on the basis of their morphological similarity with congenital viral hepatitis.",med

Besides, these matters can be of great significance to the behavioral scientist interested in human organization and communication.

2770,"PRECIS: a manual of concept analysis and subject indexing In 1951, the British Bibliography introduced the relatively new technique of chain indexing to British libraries. Twenty years later, with chain procedure established as one of the standard techniques, BNB again pioneered a new approach to subject indexing when it adopted PRECIS from its first issues of 1971. To explain why this change was felt to be necessary, we have to consider these indexing systems in the light of the new approaches to handling bibliographic data which have developed over the past decade of so. Two forces, in particular, have affected both descriptive cataloguing and subject indexing during this period; firstly, the introduction of computers; secondly, and concomitantly, the development of bibliographic data exchange networks, of which MARC is, perhaps, the primary example. In some respects, PRECIS represents a parallel development in the field of subject indexing. Traditionally, indexing systems have also tended to be dominated by the concept of a most significant term which, once identified by the indexer, would be offered as the user's access point to the alphabetical file. This applied most obviously to subject heading systems. A good deal of Cutter's ""Rules for a dictionary catalog"" is devoted to the problem of identifying this most significant term in a compound heading and presenting it as the user's access point, even when this entailed a distortion of natural language, and the production of inverted headings. The unselected component would then be lost as an entry word, unless the indexer also created a further heading or headings, in which case none of these headings would be co-extensive with the subject of the document.",cisi

(where air intakes are concerned, it is assumed that they are sharp-edged and that there is no /spillage/ of the internal flow) . the following conclusions apply to the former class of bodies . the variation of drag with mach number is found to depend only on the discontinuities in the longitudinal rate of change of the cross-sectional area, and is thus independent of cross-sectional shape . the drag itself is unchanged if the direction of the flow is reversed . the expressions for lift and moment assume the same forms as for smooth pointed bodies, the lift depending only on conditions at the base of the body . the general theory is applied to winged bodies of revolution with an unswept wing leading edge .. the results bear a marked resemblance to those obtained by ward . the results for wings alone are seen to be applicable, with one modification, to subsonic as well as to supersonic speeds .",cran

2780,"ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . ignition and combustion in a laminar mixing zone . the analytic investigation of laminar combustion processes which are essentially two- or three-dimensional present some mathematical difficulties . there are, however, several examples of two-dimensional flame propagation which involve transverse velocities that are small in comparison with that in the principal direction of flow . such examples occur in the problem of flame quenching by a cool surface, flame stabilization on a heated flat plate, combustion in laminar mixing zones, etc . in these cases the problem may be simplified by employing what is known in fluid mechanics as the boundary-layer approximation, since it was applied first by prandtl in his treatment of the viscous flow over a flat plate . physically it consists in recognizing that if the transverse velocity is small, the variations of flow properties along the direction of main flow are small in comparison with those in a direction normal to the main flow . the analytic description of the problem simplifies accordingly . the present analysis considers the ignition and combustion in the laminar mixing zone between two parallel moving gas streams . one stream consists of a cool combustible mixture, the second is hot combustion products . the two streams come into contact at a given point and a laminar mixing process follows in which the velocity distribution is modified by viscosity, and the temperature and composition distributions by conduction, diffusion, and chemical reaction . the decomposition of the combustible stream is assumed to follow first-order reaction kinetics with temperature dependence according to the arrhenius law . for a given initial velocity, composition, and temperature distribution, the questions to be answered are .. (1) does the combustible material ignite,. and (2) how far downstream of the initial contact point does the flame appear and what is the detailed process of development . since the hot stream is of infinite extent, it is found that ignition always takes place at some point of the stream . however, when the temperature of the hot stream drops below a certain value, the distance required for ignition increases so enormously that it essentially does not occur in a physical apparatus of finite dimension . the complete development of the laminar flame front is computed using an approximation similar to the integral technique introduced by von karman into boundary layer theory .",cran

2783,"A Mathematical Theory of Communication In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with the discrete nature assumed until now. To a considerable extent the continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on a discrete basis. As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case. There are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to particular cases. We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would obscure the main thread of the analysis.

2797,"1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renal homotransplantation dammin g. j. a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs has been completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants. over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed. increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questions regarding the status treated host. the current drug protocol of azathioprine and diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50% 100-day survivors. the following observations have been documented all animals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapy can be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneys apparently are protected in some way in the new environment because a second donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantation of a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decrease in renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted back to their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party, non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for the prolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a double dose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption or metabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results because two kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in the same drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient and this sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned from drugs. additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidney homografts reveal the following skin homografts are universally rejected within 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidney homografts sometimes permanently. when skin and kidney homografts from the same donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidney survival is shortened. this paradoxical effect probably is explained by the production of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney. additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female, are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalized immunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.",med

Thus, hardware, materials, and processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first, in Chapters Two through Four. The subject of information retrieval per se begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship and documentation. Because of their somewhat historical slant, these chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book which adhere to their original character. Chapter Seven presents a simplified concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine. Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have developed strongly since 1963.",cisi

Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable. It could be used for signals other than television. Voice answerback. Computers can now assembly human-voice words and speak them over the telephone. This fact, coupled with the Touchtone telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal. Millimeter-wave radio. Radio at frequencies in the band above the microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the other radio bands combined. Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute these millimeter-wave signals. Pulse code modulation. All signals, including telephone, Picturephone, music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links. Major advantages accrue from this. Computerized switching. Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and ""concentrating"" all types of signals. Data banks.

2878,"experiences with hgh treatment of twelve hypopituitary dwarfs for periods varying from 6 to 41 months are reported. all the patients were considered to have hypopituitarism from birth, four of them of the hereditary type, four possibly due to traumatic birth or neonatal asphyxia, and four from an unknown cause. in six patients detailed information concerning growth during the first year of life could be obtained. all of these patients had a degree of growth retardation before one year of age. we consider this to be the rule rather than the exception in pituitary dwarfism. the most important diagnostic evidence was a marked degree of growth retardation accompanied by a pronounced delay in skeletal maturation, and, in most cases, signs of secondary hypothyroidism, increased insulin sensitivity, and a poor response to metopyrone administration. none of the patients who had passed the normal age of puberty had maturated sexually. all twelve patients responded well to hgh therapy. during the first year of treatment the average height increment was 10 cm. ('catch-up' growth). with continued treatment a normal rate of growth, about 6 cm./year, was obtained. there was no disproportionate acceleration of skeletal maturation in any of the patients. none of them has so far become resistant to hgh administration. the oldest patient has reached normal height. whether this will be possible not only in the moderately severe, but also in the most severe cases of pituitary dwarfism, can not yet be stated. the possibility of using human gonadotrophic hormones in an attempt to produce sexual maturation in these patients is discussed briefly.",med

Establishment of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of authorship defeats this objective..

In the course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials.. Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished, that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship, including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of corporate and personal authorship..",cisi

2900,"Personnel Utilization in Libraries A Systems Approach In the late 1960s nearly all professions in the United States thought they faced severe shortages of manpower in their fields, both in professional and supporting areas. Librarianship was not immune: there was more work to be done than existing staffs could do; there were budgeted professional vacancies that could not be filled. And, concurrently, there were concerns being quietly expressed that some of the shortages could be ameliorated by a changed utilization of existing manpower. It was at this time and out of these concerns that Julius R. Chitwood, then president of the Illinois Library Association, appointed an ad hoc Committee on Manpower Training and Utilization to study patterns of staff assignments and to recommend to library administrators more effective ways of utilizing professional staff. After examining the use of professional staff in a few libraries, however, it became clear to this committee of volunteer researchers that they could not do the job which needed doing. It was also clear that a need was there, that a small segment of the library manpower problem could be more fully explored, that the results of a serious study in Illinois might have national implications, and that the resources for such a study should be sought.",cisi

In each case the positive judge was first asked to indicate what answer he inferred, and from what document passage(s).. The further discussion depended on the details of each case.. In general, the resolution procedures used will resolve a disagreement about whether a document is answer-providing or reduce it to a familiar kind of scientific disagreement (about a passage's meaning, a statement's correctness, or an inference's correctness)..

2992,"Choosing Physiology Journals For many years administrators of library collections have sought objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections in the subject fields represented by their collections. The nearest approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927. This method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the frequency of their citation. Thus, in the field of chemistry, the references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and a list is made of the most frequently cited journals. According to Gross and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry. Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have never been examined. These assumptions are: 1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional literature. 2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are representative of the entire field. 3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted equally.",cisi

3005,"How Do Scientists Meet Their Information Needs? A survey of the information use patterns and communication practices of academic physicists in the greater Boston area reveals that academic physicists rely heavily on formal and informal sources of information. Their use of formal publications concentrates on a small number of journal titles. Time and location factors play an important role in their information seeking and gathering. A considerable number of the physicists surveyed do not seek librarians' help when searching for information in the library. Although libraries have been considered largely as storehouses of materials and librarians organizers of these materials, more active roles for librarians are possible.",cisi

3014,"IFLA - Communications - FIAB The traditional pattern of organization of national and university libraries, apart from those in Germany or affected by German practice, was imposed by the weight given to the processing divisions.. The order department, which in university libraries did not include experts in book-selection, was not considered to be of comparable importance with the major department -- the cataloguing room, which also housed the classifiers.. Other divisions would be concerned with particular types of material -- maps, state papers or official documents, manuscripts, oriental books -- and would be largely autonomous with regard to acquisition and cataloguing.. The reading room staff were mainly employed in assisting readers to use the catalogue and in answering queries of a very specialized nature on the library's collections, especially on manuscripts or early printed books: they rarely dealt with the general bibliographical or reference type of enquiry which is put to present-day reference librarians.. In these circumstances members of staff tended to become expert in the work of their own department and not be invited to take any part in the activities of another.. Divisions between the various kinds of work were therefore hard and fast and the structure of the library's organization could become similarly rigid.. It must be appreciated that this is a generalization and that many libraries were more fluid in their approach. Nonetheless this conservative view of the library's function tended to freeze the administration into this form.. An expert in a particular subject field often undertook research in the subject outside the library and might occasionally be asked to deal with a reader enquiring about an aspect of his field, but usually he would not make much use of his expertise in connection with his library duties, unless of course he was appointed as a paleographer, orientalist or linguist. The appointment of subject specialists may therefore necessitate a complete re-modelling of the staff organization if their influence is to extend beyond the bounds of the old departments.",cisi

The fundamental problem of communication is that of reproducing at one point either exactly or approximately a message selected at another point. Frequently the messages have meaning; that is they refer to or are correlated according to some system with certain physical or conceptual entities. These semantic aspects of communication are irrelevant to the engineering problem. The significant aspect is that the actual message is one selected from a set of possible messages. The system must be designed to operate for each possible selection, not just the one which will actually be chosen since this is unknown at the time of design.",cisi

In classical librarianship no effort can be made to personalize the listing of titles or arrangement of volumes for an individual user. A user is unidentified, and, except for that small fraction of a percent who consult reference librarians, users remain nameless. The computer, however, with its superb ability to treat users as individual persons and events as individual events, possesses the potential for enabling big libraries to recapture the human qualities of which classical librarianship has deprived them since their days as one-librarian libraries. However, rehumanization is not the only contribution computerization will make to libraries. Developments in modern society are forcing libraries to establish new objectives. Contemporary living is information based, a phenomenon that is outmoding the venerable concept of library function. As small special libraries already do, all libraries must participate in the cultural activities of the individuals in their communities rather than merely make available a torpid ""service."" Libraries must look forward to supplying information to a user when and where he needs it - an objective impossible to attain with classical library techniques.",cisi

This process in most disciplines appears, from the dissemination point of view, to consume about five years - from the time a scientist begins his research until reports of his findings are cited in a review. To date we have conducted over sixty studies of this process and, since one of the main goals of our program is to make genuine comparisons of the scientific communication associated with the disciplines being studied, we have standardized the procedures, instruments, and analyses in those of the major studies which were conducted for all disciplines. We will present findings from the major studies conducted to date in order (1) to indicate the types of data we have collected on approximately 30,000 scientists and engineers during the past three years; (2) to indicate some of the goals of our program; and (3) to suggest a preliminary picture of the communication structure of science, as our program has led us to perceive it.",cisi

(2) there always exists a minimum r below which the motion is stable . a similar result was obtained by synge from energy considerations . synge found a limiting curve below which the motion is necessarily stable . the author's discussion of the asymptotic behavior of the curves shows further that there always exists a maximum value of a beyond which the motion is stable for all reynolds numbers . hence the qualitative shape of the curve is determined . the author proceeds to show that simple approximate expressions for the stability limit can be obtained from his general analysis for a given velocity profile . these approximate stability limits for plane poiseuille flow and blasius flow are found to be r=5906 and r=502 . the reynolds numbers are based on the width of the channel and the displacement thickness, respectively . finally, the method for computing the complete instability curve is presented and the plane poiseuille case and the blasius problem worked out in detail . the stability limit for blasius flow had been given before by tollmien and schlichting . the present more exact computations agree well with tollmien's result as far as the minimum critical reynolds number is concerned . the value found here is r=420 . the neutral curve for poiseuille motion had not been obtained before . the minimum critical number here is found to be r=5314 . the agreement with the estimate from the simple criterion mentioned above is thus very good . a discussion of the physical significance of the viscous effects and of future developments concludes the paper .",cran

3098,"speech and reading problems in childhood. the following communicative disorders have been discussed: functional articulation defects, delayed speech development, stuttering, hearing loss, cleft palate, neurological disorders, and reading disorders. these disorders rarely have a single cause. they are the result of an intermingling of many factors, some physiological and some psychological, some residing within the child and some in the parents and environment in general. delayed or defective speech is a cause for great concern to most parents and teachers. the public health worker who listens with an attentive and sympathetic ear may allay some of this anxiety and thus help foster healthy emotional development in the child. the existence of a more serious condition underlying the presenting communication problem, even if sensed by the parents, is frequently denied. the public health worker can assist the parents in the painful process of facing up to their fears. a child with a communication problem is still a child and the public health worker by simply reflecting this to the parents and advising them on normal child-raising practices can, again, be of help to the child. children with speech deviations are exposed to an overabundance of well-intentioned speech correction at home. most of it is ineffective; some of it, unfortunately is harmful. while the worker may not be in a position to offer specific advice on a particular child, the manner in which the parents and teacher are handling the child's communication problem can be explored and damaging practices possibly eliminated. the fact that there may be a diagnostic and treatment center to which the child can be referred does not vitiate the public health worker's role. the public health physician and public health nurse have a valuable contribution to make in helping the parents, school, and child accept the chronic nature of the disorder.",med

3131,"the effect of human growth hormone in hypopituitary dwarfism human growth hormone (hgh) raben has been used in a dosage of 2 mg./m.2/day or 5 mg./m.2 twice weekly. this dosage is probably in or below, but certainly not above, the range of physiological replacement therapy. in a standardized five-day metabolic hgh test hypopituitary dwarfs retain more n than children without gh deficiency. this test is valuable diagnostic help in hypopituitary dwarfism. a prolonged treatment with hgh accelerates growth in hypopituitary dwarfs but not in children without gh deficiency. growth rate, induced by this treatment, is first above average and later average or below average for age. this decreasing response to hgh is typical for the general phenomenon of catch-up growth and is not caused by the develop- ment of antibodies. of 9 hypopituitary dwarfs, treated for at least 9 months, 3 were growth resistant from the beginning in spite of a high n retention in the preceding hgh test. this resistance is caused by the development of high titres of specific hgh antibodies in the very first few months of treatment. these antibodies suppress the effect of hgh both on metabolism and on growth. the unexpected occasional induction in man of antibodies against a homologous protein hormone is of great interest. the possibility that these antibodies might be active not only against the homogenous but also against the endogenous hormone could have a far-reaching biological importance.",med

3147,"Library Optimum Sir,-In his recent article B.C. Brookes propounds an ingenious mathematical framework to determine which periodical volumes a library should hold. He is careful to point out that the selection will need regular review and revision, in case the value of the aging factor a or the contents of the Bradford set change from year to year. There is as yet very little experimental evidence on the consistency of either. Such limited evidence as there is suggests that the aging factor is reasonably constant. But the position of the Bradfod set is less satisfactory. The Nature Conservancy librarians (J. M. Weingott and S. M. Penny, unpublished) have lent me a list of titles cited in the Journal of Ecology three or more times in 1955-56, and a similar list for 1965-66. There are 150 periodical titles in the two lists, but only forty-two (28%) appear in both. Of the thirty-three titles cited nine or more times in either year, only eight (25%) attained that level in both, and twelve were cited less than three times in the other year. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient between the two years is 0.18 and not significant. There is another major practical problem. The article assumes that the data analyzed to obtain aging or utility factors and Bradford sets are valid parameters of the relative value of the literature to the readers. There is no mention of the type of data to use. The reader who sought guidance from the earlier literature cited would find practical techniques described in which analyses of citation frequencies are used to calculate utilities discussed in terms of library use. Krauze and Hillinger have discussed the difference between citations in one article and future citations to that article. Their work implies a more complex relation between a and u than Brookes suggests. In any case, the validity of citations for forecasting library consultations remains unproven, and there are prima facie reasons why the relationship is not necessarily close. For example, one item in a list of references is often intended to lead to a chain of earlier papers. Again, each citation represents an author's selection from a wider group most of which he has consulted in a library. In neither case is there any inherent reason for similarity of age distribution or of pool of titles between the list of citations and the items read by the author or his readers.",cisi

3165,"2542. symposium on the fine structure and replication of bacteria and their parts. ii. bacterial cytoplasm comparison of the fine structure of the cytoplasm of the bacterial cell with that of the 'cell in general' reveals important differences leading to the conclusion that, in the bacterial cytoplasm, there is little differentiation into separate functional en- tities. there is no nuclear membrane, and fine fibrils appear to extend from the nucleo- plasm into the cytoplasm where they may expand in all directions. the cytoplasm is not necessarily intersected by membranous profiles of special configuration, as is borne out by e. coli b and other gram-negative organisms. when membranous profiles of special configuration are present, as in the gram-positive b. subtilis, these do not appear differentiated into clearly definable endoplasmic reticulum, golgi substance, microbodies, etc., and mitochondria. as for kinetosomes, the presence of centrioles is perhaps not very likely. the experiments in which tellurite is re- duced in the cells suggest that there are structures at the base of the flagella with reductive capacity. however, upon application of the tetranitro-blue tetrazolium technic to b. subtilis, these are not stained. they are presumably identical with basal granules. the membranous structures in b. subtilis are called chondrioids by the author because probably one of their functions is that they are the sites of the respiratory enzyme chain. in the gram-negative p. vulgaris, the probable site of the respiratory chain has a structure very different from that in the bacillus; it is not clear whether membranes are involved in their structure. morphologically, even in b. subtilis chondrioids differ fundamentally from the mitochondria in that they are not built up from composite membranes, they are extensions of the plasma membrane, and they may not be completely closed systems. regarding this last point, it was observed that chondrioids may possibly stand in open connection with the cell's environment, since its lumen is not separated from the cell wall by a plasma membrane. although as yet nothing is known about this, it does not seem to be precluded that these membranous organelles may function also as intracellular transport systems. contrary to porter's ideas about er, the chondrioids are not extensions of a nuclear envelope, but of the plasma membrane. on the other hand, they are in the nuclear area, in direct contact with the nucleoplasm, and therefore, perhaps, they need not carry in their interior some dna, as is now becoming known for ordinary mitochondria. the chromatophore vesicle is of a simple structure and in connection with the plasma membrane. it is covered by a single membrane and thus resembles the granum disc, but it is much smaller. in tissue cells, an im- portant function of the er is the support of protein synthesis by ribosomes bound to their surfaces. evidence is now accumulating that the active complexes for poly- peptide synthesis in bacteria are also membrane-bound and are series of 70s ribo- somes using the same messenger rna molecule. it remains a contradictory situ- ation that the particles obtained here through release of cytoplasm from protoplasts in diluted, rather crude fixing media, and identified as ribosomes, could not be recognized as such in thin sections of the ryter-kellenberger fixed protoplasts. this point is much in need of clarification. but even if the cytoplasm in the thin sections of the protoplasts is in a state of dispersion brought about artificially, it is still apparent from the various micrographs that basically the cytoplasm is a network of presumably linear arrays, with many interconnections due to fibrillar systems. fibrils from the nucleoplasm penetrate deeply into the cytoplasm. the presence of fine fibrils of various thicknesses, electron densities, and orientations makes high-resolution study of the cytoplasmic details an intriguing prospect from which much fundamental information can be gained. the organizational pattern on the ultrastructural level in bacteria reveals fundamental similarities and divergen- cies from that in the 'cell in general'.",med

3182,"1545. the effect of combined glucose and insulin infusions on the lipoid and carbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman and of the fetus the infusion of glucose with insulin during delivery was used by the authors pri- marily in order to determine, whether the utilization of glucose can be enhanced under these conditions. they wanted to investigate, whether the increase of unesteri- fied fatty acids in the cord blood which takes place after a sole glucose infusion in the mother, could be caused by the low capability of glucose utilization in the fetus. the infusion during delivery which consisted of the application of 500 ml of 10% glucose and 16 u of insulin over a period of 30 min. brought about a greater decrease of unesterified fatty acids in the parturient woman as compared with the infusion of glucose exclusively. the reason for this result is thought to be due to a better utili- zation of glucose which is favorably influenced by insulin. during the infusion of glucose with insulin, an increase in the values of lactic and pyruvic acid took place in the parturient women; this was probably due to an accelerated glycolysis and an increased production of lactic acid, but not caused by a higher share of the anaerobic metabolism. in the cord blood, there were likewise increased values of lactic and py- ruvic acid as a reflection of the higher values of these substances in the mother. the formation of these products of metabolic breakdown by the fetus, however, was not significantly increased. after infusion of glucose with insulin, the other investigated parameter values, including those of the levels of unesterified fatty acids are found in the cord blood in similar amounts as after infusion of glucose alone. these re- sults cannot reliably prove the passage of insulin through the placenta especially after a continued study of the metabolic values in newborns. as a proof of the passage of insulin through the placenta could not be established, it is possible that after an intake of insulin the increase of unesterified fatty acids in the cord blood could be caused by a relative insufficiency of the insular apparatus of the fetus. the most probable reason for the increase of unesterified fatty acids is the different depo- sition and metabolization of unesterified fatty acids in the course of intrauterine life.",med

If one ignored the major historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read), notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental needs. The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues as announced to cover only libraries. Its attention to librarianship is very limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned. Furthermore, the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the development of the image of the library and librarian. The aim here has been to tie it all together. In the present offering, ""the West"" is used conventionally: European civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere progeny. The limitation is practical. To try to ""cover"" even the West may prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.

If the order in a system cannot keep pace with the increasing requirements, its working capability will continuously decrease, because the searcher is becoming more and more overburdened in relation to his available search time, search patience, and search memory. The degree of order attainable in a growing literature collection can be estimated on the basis of six postulates. The better the requirements imposed by these postulates are approximated in a practical documentation system, the higher are its working capability and life expectancy, but the expenditure to be made on the literature analyses must also inevitably be higher.

However, his conclusion misses the mark, since, for one not completely the master of the system of classification, there is no approach to the classed catalog save through an index, yet the index is not in fact as complete and direct a guide to the subject content of the library's collections as an alphabetical catalog rationally and fully cross-referenced.",cisi

3238,"On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and Information Retrieval This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. The resulting technique called ""Probabilistic Indexing,"" allows a computing machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference and derive a number (called the ""relevance number"") for each document, which is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request ranked according to their probable relevance.. The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library system the cross-referencing (""see"" and ""see also"") is based solely on the ""semantical closeness"" between index terms, statistical measures of closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant documents that would not otherwise have been selected.. Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..",cisi

3244,"A Probabilistic Search Strategy for MEDLARS One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each reference with a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrieved and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many relevant references as the Boolean searches..",cisi

In the frequency domain, distributed systems described by the general (linear) telegrapher's equations are considered, over a finite band of frequencies.. An electric network, equivalent to these systems, is developed.. Many optimization problems, that are of practical interest, are formulated in terms of this new equivalent network.. Some of the basic principles of lumped network theory are applied to formulate these optimization problems.. Many advantages in the method of solution due to this formulation are discussed.. In the time domain, a method of characteristics is developed as a method of solution for optimization problems.. First and second order hyperbolic systems are considered.. Imbedding and Gradient techniques developed along the characteristics are shown to have numerous computational advantages..

3246,"Quantitative Fuzzy Semantics The point of departure in this paper is the definition of a language, L, as a fuzzy relation from a set of terms, T = {x}, to a universe of discourse, U = {y}.. As a fuzzy relation, L is characterized by its membership function mL:T*U -> [0,1], which associates with each ordered pair (x,y) its grade of membership, mL(x,y), in L.. Given a particular x in T, the membership function mL(x,y) defines a fuzzy set, M(x), in U whose membership function is given by mM(x)(y) = mL(X,y).. The fuzzy set M(x) is defined to be the meaning of the term x, with x playing the role of a name for M(x).. If a term x in T is a concatenation of other terms in T, that is, x = x1 ... xn, xi T, i epsilon 1,...,n, then the meaning of x can be expressed in terms of the meanings of x1,...,xn through the use of a lambda-expression or by solving a system of equations in the membership functions of the xi which are deduced from the syntax tree of x..

3250,"A Graph-Theoretic Algorithm for Matching Chemical Structures There are many chemical retrieval systems which process the first type of request efficiently. Most of these systems are also capable of handling certain fragment requests; however, the fragments which can be processed are frequently of a restricted nature. For example, in retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are readily detected. To allow a completely general specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query and library structures. A technique for making such detailed comparisons is presented in this report. This technique is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching procedures. Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm, some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is presented to illustrate the over-all concepts. Then the flow diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional examples. Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for a digital computer is discussed.

As world-wide stresses have increased, many individuals and organizations have begun to study and to influence the changing aspects of the world situation. But it seems fair to observe that most of the activity has been addressed to separate facets of the world system. Little has yet been done to show how the many actions and forces are affecting one another to produce the total consequences that we observe. Now however, many persons are coming to believe that the interactions within the whole are more important than the sum of the separate parts. This book was undertaken as one step toward showing how the behavior of the world system results from mutual interplay between its demographic, industrial, and agricultural subsystems.",cisi

The broader concept, foreign aid or foreign assistance, means providing another country with any kind of goods, whether financial, commodity, or manpower, to almost any purpose, and extends to antiquity. Technical assistance, which may be defined, on the other hand, as the supplying of techniques, is an outgrowth of the industrial revolution and parallels America's rise in the nineteenth century to world recognition as an important industrial and trade power. Government use of such aid as an instrument of foreign policy, as well as the integration of these private and public efforts in the foreign assistance field, began to develop under President Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy.

He wants the index to help him to generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations. He wants the index to help him in terms of his language, logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific approach, whichever occurs to him first.

3320,"Information Needs and Uses Information science meets behavioral science in the study of information needs and uses. At first, the meeting of these fields was inconclusive. Until the mid-1960's, there were only a few substantial studies of information needs and uses. Since about 1963, however, a significant literature has grown rapidly. There is evidence now of a productive entente between the fields. When information scientists see reliable, valid, and nontrivial data on users' behavior, they begin to use behavioral criteria in evaluating information system performance. When behavioral scientists glimpse the full complexity of dissemination, documentation, storage, and retrieval processes, they offer fewer naive solutions to ""the information problem."" This mutual education and accommodation will undoubtedly continue. Information science and behavioral science need each other. Big Science needs them both.",cisi

There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small.. It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on libraries..",cisi

(these assumptions may be compared with the empirical relations suggested by cope .) it is shown that a transformation of the ordinate normal to the layer can lead to a simplified form of equation of motion very similar to the ordinary incompressible equation but modified by a multiplicative factor g in the pressure term . this factor is greater than unity at the boundary and tends to one at the outside of the layer . several particular solutions are considered including accelerated flow with a linearly increasing velocity and retarded flow along a flat plate with a linearly decreasing velocity . the general implications of the theory are discussed and qualitative conclusions are drawn when the mainstream velocity starts from a stagnation point, rises to a maximum and subsequently falls . it is concluded that for such a velocity distribution increasing compressibility will reduce the skin friction, increase the boundary layer thickness and cause earlier separation as compared with the incompressible flow with the same mainstream velocity distribution and the kinematic viscosity corresponding to conditions at the stagnation point .",cran

The United States Steel Corporation is a formal organization; so is the Red Cross, the corner grocery store, the New York State Highway Department. The latter organization is, of course, part of a larger one - the New York State government. But for present purposes we need not trouble ourselves about the precise boundaries to be drawn around an organization or the exact distinction between an ""organization"" and a ""nonorganization."" We are dealing with empirical phenomena, and the world has an uncomfortable way of not permitting itself to be fitted into clean classifications. Authors are often convinced that the particular subjects with which they are dealing are more significant than the world has acknowledged. We cheerfully make this claim for organization theory. However much organizations occupy the thoughts of practicing executives and administrators, and however many books for these practitioners have been written about them, the theory of organizations occupies an insignificant place in modern social science. Most current psychology and sociology textbooks do not devote even a short chapter to the subject of formal organizations. The Handbook of Social Psychology (Lindzey, 1954) contains chapters on small groups, mass media, ""industrial social psychology"" (with only passing references to organizations), leadership, and voting behavior.

3402,"Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition for a particular scientific contribution depending on their location in the stratification system. Merton originally introduced the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of multiple discoveries or collaborators. In this paper the concept is generalized to apply to all scientific work. If the Matthew Effect were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system. To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of similar design. In each study we control for the number of citations papers received at time 2. This enables us to look at groups of papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2. We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's location in the stratification system. All the data indicate that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification variables. However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery. The Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious points of the social system of science. All other stratification variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards did not influence the speed of diffusion. Data are presented that indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low- ranking scientists. The Matthew Effect also serves to focus attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame. A discussion is included of the relevance of these data for the study of resistance to scientific discoveries.",cisi

For documentation and information retrieval in general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and machine selection are also available. That classification is of value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is, however, made evident in two ways. First, to achieve consistency and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce classificatory techniques. Second, there is a continuing demand for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively cultivated fields of knowledge. It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that this guide has been prepared. The techniques of detailed depth classification have been greatly developed during the past decade, and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed. These developments have been reported mainly as research papers in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology. There is a need for a more simply written and more readily available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of classification.",cisi

Two approaches to a solution are described. One is called the hybrid inverted list; the other is based upon an old technique called super-imposed coding. The former has been implemented and has recently been installed in an operational system. Some statistics related to file characteristics in this application are provided, but operational cost and performance statistics are not yet available.",cisi

Someone has observed that the roots of the present lie deep in the past and must be uncovered to understand fully how the present came to be what it is. This study is less a descriptive history of library schools and their work than a search for perspective within which major problems, as well as the course pursued in resolving them, can be more fully understood. The original study, begun in 1941-42, sought to throw light on how library education at that time came to be what is was. The present study continues beyond the early forming of the American library school to the reforming of basic lines of policy and organization.

The JCI consists of a journal by journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index.. A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary journals as cross field information links..

For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual level..",cisi

Palermo has appropriately summarized Kuhn's analysis. It seems, if we judge by constant citations of Kuhn and the references to paradigms, crises and revolutions among scientists and philosophers, that he has induced a novel self-consciousness about the growth of scientific knowledge and the nature of cumulativeness in the expansion of understanding - and not least among psychologists. This may be in small part (though I doubt it) because one of psychology's concerns is the empirical study of the growth of knowledge: Jean Piaget, whose influence in some quarters has now become so great that he is hailed as a revolutionary in those quarters, has for several decades been developing a theory of the growth of knowledge - or, if you insist, of the development of cognition - which, like Kuhn's account (in his preface Kuhn acknowledges illumination from Piaget), eschews accumulation and posits a sequence of qualitative changes each of which completely reorganizes thinking.",cisi

To put the difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language structure.

3608,"parathyroid function in chronic renal failure. a statistical survey of the plasma biochemistry in azotaemic renal osteodystrophy. a collection has been made of 134 personal and published cases of azotemic osteodystrophy in which adequate information was available concerning the pathological state of the bones. measurements were available of the plasma calcium, plasma phosphate, and blood-urea-nitrogen in all cases, and of plasma bicarbonate and plasma proteins in a representative sample. the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in the whole series of 134 cases were not related reciprocally but were correlated directly. these data were further analyzed by allocating each case to either of 2 sub-groups, according to the type of pathological lesions present in the bones. in one group there was evidence of defective mineralization of skeletal tissues, in the form of either rickets or osteomalacia, and the plasma-calcium was found to be statistically sub-normal. in the other group there was no primary defect of mineralization but the lesions of generalized osteitis fibrosa were present and the plasma calcium was statistically normal. there was no significant correlation between the plasma levels of calcium and phosphate in either sub-group; and the plasma phosphate was significantly higher in the group with the higher plasma calcium levels. the data indicate that in patients with renal osteodystrophy, contrary to general belief, the plasma calcium varies independently of the plasma phosphate. since these results imply differences in parathyroid function among patients with azotemic osteodystrophy, a survey has also been made of the recorded parathyroid weights in chronic renal failure. generalized osteitis fibrosa and the accompanying normal levels of plasma calcium are associated with greater parathyroid hypertrophy than is found in most cases of chronic renal failure or cases with defective mineralization. the various data are interpreted in relation to the known metabolic disturbances and natural history of azotemic osteodystrophy. by analogy with states of simple vitamin d deficiency, it is suggested that hypocalcemia and relative unresponsiveness to the calcemic action of parathyroid hormone are related to an acquired resistance to vitamin d. the group of cases with statistically normal plasma-calcium prove that the parathyroid glands can function effectively in some patients with chronic renal failure, irrespective of the level of the plasma phosphate. the size of the glands and the effects of sub-total parathyroidectomy in patients of this group suggest that the normal plasma calcium results from an increased production of parathyroid hormone. the more advanced renal failure in the normocalcemic, as compared with the hypocalcemic, cases could mean that the development of an effective degree of secondary hyperparathyroidism is a function of the duration of the renal disease. it seems likely that when the parathyroid response is sufficient to overcome the effects of the vitamin d resistance it also entails the development of generalized osteitis fibrosa, healing of the defect of mineralization and increased liability to metastatic calcification.",med

3625,"Statistical Bibliography in Relation to the Growth of Modern Civilization The following pages form the concluding portion of four lectures delivered by me in the University of Cambridge as Sandars Reader in Bibliography, 1921. As the two pairs of lectures appeal to widely different classes of the community, I have decided to print them separately, though the underlying theme is the same, viz. the need for uniformity in book classification as a preliminary to co-operative action in library administration and bibliography. Book classification is shelf classification, and shelf classification carried to its furthest limits leads necessarily to uniformity in the extension and definition of its classes. Add to this a chronological order of books in their classes and your scheme of classification acquires a new value; for it presents for each period a bibliographical counterpart of the corresponding growth of the activities of the human mind. My first two lectures dealt with this thesis in its practical application to library work and the compilation of subject bibliographies. Here statistical bibliography is considered in relation to the growth of modern civilization. Strictly speaking, the province of statistical bibliography ends with the presentation of the figures compiled. Their final interpretation should be left to those possessing the necessary qualifications. I am, therefore, conscious that in attempting to furnish some explanation of the interrelations of the various factors which are associated with the growth of modern civilization, I have outstripped the limits of bibliographical propriety. On this count I offer no defense.",cisi
3626,"The Divided Catalog: A Summary of the Literature In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly predominant type of catalog in libraries. He questions its advocates' claim that it best meets a library's needs. He advocates a divided catalog such as the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject fields. We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography (Harris, 1957). Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject of the divided catalog. During that period there were probably some divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the greatest period of such activity started in 1937. Our survey of the literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.",cisi

The MARC records provided a search data base for an experiment in current awareness service designed to furnish faculty with biweekly lists of bibliographic notices of new monographs in their specified fields of interest.. Of the 298 social sciences faculty members queried about their interest in participating, 209 (70 percent) responded affirmatively.. Only 40 participants could be accommodated, so they were chosen in proportion to the number of faculty members in each department or school: anthropology-l, business-10, economics-3, education-15, government-4, history-4, and sociology-3.. An ""interest"" statement from each faculty member was translated into both Library of Congress classification numbers (e.g., E6ll) and subject heading terms, i.e., elements of discrete heading separated by a comma, dash, parenthesis, or period (e.g., U.S.--HIST.--CIVIL WAR--PRISONERS, EXCHANGE OF becomes six terms: U/S/HIST/CIVIL WAR/PRISONERS/EXCHANGE OF).. The resulting ""interest profiles"" were recorded on punched cards for computer matching with subject headings and class numbers.. The weighted term search strategy was used in comparing profiles with MARC records.. Each profile was assigned a ""cutoff weight"" or ""hit level"" of 6.. Subject heading terms were assigned positive or negative weights so that the sum of weights on matching terms would be equal to, exceed, or be less than the hit level, thereby appropriately causing or preventing the selection of a particular record.. All class numbers were assigned a weight of 6 so that a hit would occur on any matching number.. Three computer programs were employed in producing the SDI lists.. Program Extract used MARC Master Tapes as input and extracted the card number (accession number), subject heading terms, and class number for current records; Program Retrieve compared these terms and class numbers with those in the profiles and recorded the card numbers for ""hits""; Program Print compared these card numbers with those on complete MARC records and printed three copies of each record to be sent to the faculty.. One copy was for the faculty member's own use; one was to be evaluated and returned; and one was to be used for making recommendations to the library.. Subject headings proved to be more effective in searching the MARC file mainly because multiple subject headings may be assigned to each record, whereas there is only one class number; and a hit often occurred on a record's second or third heading.. The SDI system performed well in selecting performed well in selecting relevant records, and overall evaluations were highly favorable.. Some 73 percent of notices received by faculty members were for works judged new to the faculty. The majority felt that the SDI service provided an automatic, regular notification of new works.. They felt that it usually brought works to their attention quicker than other sources; it informed them of items they otherwise would have missed; it furnished a compact source listing books in all but only their fields; it required very little time; and it provided a convenient means for making library recommendations and therefore increased the amount of recommending done.. All faculty expressed a desire to have SDI service continued..",cisi

Their success in this activity has been reflected in the increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.

The processes are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its predecessor.

In the present case it would not have been considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this first volume to the point of no return. It is true that these exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to follow them up. On the other hand, as most of them were written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting repetitiveness presented a special problem. With occasional exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only at the cost of mutilating individual papers. The solution adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped without loss by readers of the earlier chapters. Where some comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or postscript to the original papers, the passages added have been italicized.",cisi

3722,"stimulus overload, action cycles, and the completion gradient systematic inquiries into the origin of certain emotional disturbances of infants show that consistent maternal care is vital for the child's normal physical, psychic, and social development, indeed, for his survival. the most elementary precondition for consistent maternal care is the physical presence of the mother or her substitute. it has, however, become increasingly apparent that children's development can also be stunted, and that they suffer damage of varying extent by the attention of, and close contact with, a mother who dispenses what seems to be the ""wrong kind of mothering"". a model of the mother-baby interaction is proposed to explicate the dynamics of the ""wrong kind of mothering"" and its consequences: my proposition is that the mutual exchanges between mother and baby consist in a give and take of action and reaction between the two partners, which requires from each of them both active and passive responses. these responses form series and chains, the single links of which consist in what i call ""action cycles,"" each completed in itself and at the same time anticipating the next link. i designated these seriated response exchanges as the ""precursor of dialogue,"" as a primal dialogue. the dialogue acts as a vector of the baby's development, influencing its direction and stimulating it to adaptive efforts and psychic growth. it follows that inappropriate mothering (quantitatively as well as qualitatively) results in what is referred to at this time as the ""derailment"" of the primal dialogue. controlled experiments with animals, findings of experimental psychology, and, lastly, clinical findings illustrate the mechanics of the derailed dialogue and its sequelae. in the cases under review a surfeit of stimulation, a psychic overloading, resulted in the derailment of dialogue. overloading prevents its subject from completing actions or responses initiated by him. long-lasting overload results in the cumulation of ""incompleted action cycles"". the sequelae of this cumulation are profound changes in the behavior of the individual. these changes are manifested in a departure from the norms of individual and social behavior patterns that are maladaptive for the individual and asyntonic with his society, that is, asocial. the derailment of the dialogue is triggered, perhaps even caused, by the nature of the social setting. one setting, over-population, is extensively discussed in connection with an animal experiment, and the implications for the human community are examined.",med
3723,"MEDLARS: A Summary Review and Evaluation of Three Reports The MEDLARS (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System) system at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) has over the past few years been one of the most significant and one of the most publicized automated bibliographic information retrieval systems. Over two hundred articles on it have appeared in American newspapers and popular magazines, in specialized medical journals throughout the world, and in a variety of library journals. The publicity that has attended this project has, in a way, been unfortunate, for it has presented an exaggerated picture of the system and its accomplishments which has only made the sceptics more skeptical; and it has obscured in part the examination of MEDLARS' real accomplishments. There has to date been very little careful outside analysis and evaluation of MEDLARS. Over 50 percent of all the articles listed in the bibliography in Austin's report, and virtually all the substantive ones, represent the work of persons closely connected with NLM or the development of the MEDLARS system. Their judgement on the effectiveness of the system and its overall value cannot help but be colored by this connection.",cisi

The fundamental notion of stability of an epidemic process is introduced and a stability theorem is derived..

Pontryagin's maximum principle is applied to the problem of achieving optimal control of an epidemic process and it is shown that stability of the process is equivalent to stability in the sense of Lyapunov..

Such a vocabulary related to a group of request terms is believed to be a much more powerful tool for selecting documents from a collection than has been available heretofore..

3747,"Citation Indexes for Science In this paper I propose a bibliographic system for science literature that can eliminate the uncritical citation of fraudulent, incomplete, or obsolete data by making it possible for the conscientious scholar to be aware of criticisms of earlier papers. It is too much to expect a research worker to spend an inordinate amount of time searching for the bibliographic descendants of antecedent papers. It would not be excessive to demand that the thorough scholar check all papers that have cited or criticized such papers, if they could be located quickly. The citation index makes this check practicable. Even if there were no other use for a citation index than that of minimizing the citation of poor data, the index would be well worth the effort required to compile it. This paper considers the possible utility of a citation index that offers a new approach to subject control of the literature of science. By virtue of its different construction, it tends to bring together material that would never be collated by the usual subject indexing. It is best described as an association-of-ideas index, and it gives the reader as much leeway as he requires. Suggestiveness through association-of-ideas is offered by conventional subject indexes but only within the limits of a particular subject heading.",cisi

3763,"Aspects of the Theory of Syntax The idea that a language is based on a system of rules determining the interpretation of its infinitely many sentences is by no means novel. Well over a century ago, it was expressed with reasonable clarity by Wilhelm von Humboldt in his famous but rarely studied introduction to general linguistics (Humboldt, 1836). His view that a language ""makes infinite use of finite means"" and that its grammar must describe the processes that make this possible is, furthermore, a outgrowth of a persistent concern, within rationalistic philosophy of language and mind, with this ""creative"" aspect of language use (for discussion, see Chomsky, 1964, forthcoming). What is more, it seems that even Panini's grammar can be interpreted as a fragment of such a ""generative grammar,"" in essentially the contemporary sense of this term. This monograph is an exploratory study of various problems that have arisen in the course of work on transformational grammar, which is presupposed throughout as a general framework for the discussion. What is at issue here is precisely how this theory should be formulated. This study deals, then, with questions that are at the border of research in transformational grammar. For some, definite answers will be proposed; but more often the discussion will merely raise issues and consider possible approaches to them without reaching any definite conclusions.",cisi

3770,"The Development of Reference Services through Academic Traditions, Public Library Practice and Special Librarianship Modern American library history has received only sporadic attention as a subject for investigation. Though we have now accumulated an adequate supply of source materials to draw upon in the form of annual reports, service studies, biographical accounts, and chronicles of individual libraries, no one has yet fashioned out of these materials a critical history of American librarianship. To paraphrase Leo LaMontagne, we have salvaged remnants from the past, but we have yet to convert them into history. The lack has cost the profession dearly. Even a casual survey of the literature of librarianship reveals the shocking degree of duplication and naivete that stem from an insufficient awareness of previous efforts. There is clearly room and need for a series of evaluative studies of the development of American library services which could eventually be put together to form the desired definitive history of American librarianship. The present dissertation is intended as a contribution toward that end. It undertakes to furnish the historical background for one of the continuing problems of American librarianship - the provision of reference services in research libraries.",cisi

3772,"The Chemical Abstracts Service Chemical Registry System. I. General Design The Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Chemical Registry System is a computer- based system that uniquely identifies chemical substances on the basis of composition and structure. Since initial operation in 1964 as a stand-alone input, storage, and retrieval system for structural representations of organic chemical compounds, the scope of the CAS Registry System has steadily increased to include all types of chemical substances and the entire system has been integrated into CAS indexing operations. The third refinement of this system, Registry III, which has been in operation for over a year, involves major changes in Registry recods but no change in the basic algorithmic techniques for registering chemical substances. The previous format for listing atoms and bonds has been modified so that each ring system is now separately identified, and this ring-system identifier is used in the record for each substance that contains that ring. These modifications support CAS nomenclature derivation and also a computer-based structure output system. The general design of Registry III, which involves a structure record of cyclic and acyclic segments, is presented.",cisi

3784,"A Note on the Pseudo-Mathematics of Relevance Recently a number of articles, books, and reports dealing with information systems, i.e., document retrieval systems, have advanced the doctrine that such systems are to be evaluated in terms of the degree or percentage of relevancy they provide. Although there seems to be little agreement on what relevance means, and some doubt that it is quantifiable, there is, nevertheless, a growing agreement that a fixed and formal relationship exists between the relevance and the recall performance of any system. Thus, we will find in the literature both a frankly subjective notion of relevance as reported by individual users, and equations, curves, and mathematical formulations which presumably provide numerical measures of the recall and relevance characteristics of information systems. This phenomenon of shifting back and forth from an admittedly subjective and non-mathematical term to equations in which the same term is given a mathematical value or a mathematical definition has its ancient parallel in discussions of probability. One cannot, of course, legislate the meaning of a term. It all depends, as Alice pointed out, on ""who is master,"" the user or the term. On the other hand, the use of a single term in the same document to cover two or more distinct meanings, especially when such a usage is designed to secure the acceptance of a doctrine by attributing to it mathematical validity which it does not have, represents a more serious situation than merely careless ambiguity.",cisi

3786,"Journal Usage Patterns and their Implications in the Planning of Library Systems Access to the literature is an essential requirement for advanced research.. Libraries, particularly academic libraries, have traditionally borne the major responsibility for providing public access to the world's literature.. Most universities have developed rather complex multilibrary systems of specialized libraries in order to meet the needs of various groups which they serve.. This use of special libraries to meet the needs of particular groups has, generally, resulted in a somewhat arbitrary division of the literature by disciplines.. The purpose of this study is to investigate some of the effects that this division of the literature has on its accessibility and in particular to examine the disciplines, the interdisciplinary relationships, and the scattering characteristics as they are revealed by journal usage patterns.. These results are applied to the problem of planning and design of library systems.. Measures of journal productivity are proposed and means of actually estimating these measures, based on citations, usage, and abstract data are developed.. Each of these means of estimating journal productivity has its advantages and limitations.. Since these value measures are usually made relative to a particular discipline, many problems arise unless disciplines can be defined in comparable terms.. A ""discipline wheel"" is proposed which can serve as a conceptual framework in which to view the different disciplines.. This framework provides a basis for measuring the breadth of a discipline and also for measuring the similarity between two disciplines.. One of the more important characteristics which has emerged from the study of journal productivity is the concept of ""scattering"" of articles or ""title dispersion"".. A powerful tool for describing this phenomenon which has resulted from earlier studies is the Bradford distribution.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to over fifty groups of productivity data from various sources with mixed results.. Other possible distributions, particularly the Yule, Borel, and the Fisher distributions, are also considered.. The applications of productivity functions in the operation, design, and evaluation of library systems are virtually unlimited.. Their use in determining the size of a collection, finding the marginal value of adding additional journals to a collection, determining user convenience, and building mathematical models of library systems are among some of the applications which are considered.. It is also possible, based on productivity functions, to predict the comprehensiveness of a particular library system as a function of the number of subscriptions it receives.. The Purdue University Libraries provided an actual library system to which the above concepts could be applied.. A large set of citation data was collected.. This data consisted of 24,953 citations from 752 Ph.D. dissertations written in technical fields at Purdue University.. Complete records of the university's scientific journal holdings were also obtained.. The Bradford distribution is fitted to the citation data with generally satisfactory results.. The similarity between the different scientific disciplines is measured as is the similarity between the different libraries.. The breadth of the disciplines is also measured.. Differences between the journal usage patterns and the system's holdings are examined.. Alternate library system configurations are proposed and evaluated through the use of comprehensiveness functions.. This study shows that it is possible to quantitatively measure such concepts as title dispersion, breadth of a discipline, the similarity between disciplines, and others.. The quantification of these concepts leads to a basis for the design and evaluation of complete library systems..",cisi

Compared to other types of societies, this one demands a wider variety of higher level skills and thus generates much pressure against the forces that in all societies tend to keep the individual in his original caste or class. Much of the resulting mobility is based on a radical change which has taken place in the occupational structure of modern industrial societies, one which neither Marx nor orthodox economists anticipated, an expansion of the demand for professional and technical skills of a high order.

3806,"a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamic forces on oscillating or steady finite wings at subsonic speeds . a systematic kernel function procedure for determining aerodynamic forces on oscillating or steady finite wings at subsonic speeds . a detailed description is given of a method of approximating solutions to the integral equation that relates oscillatory or steady lift and downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow . the method of solution is applicable to general plan forms with either curved or straight leading and trailing edges . moreover, it is directly applicable to control surfaces such as all-movable tails but modifications are needed to apply it to controls in general . applications of the method involve evaluations of numerous integrals that must be handled by numerical procedures but systematic schemes of evaluations have been adopted that are well suited to the routines of automatic digital computing machines . these schemes of evaluation have been incorporated in a program for an ibm 704 electronic data processing machine . with this machine, a pressure distribution together with such quantities as section or total lift and moment coefficients or generalized forces can be determined for a given value of frequency and mach number and for several /four or five/ modes of oscillation in about 4 minutes of machine time . in the case of steady downwash conditions corresponding quantities can be obtained in about 2 minutes of machine time . in order to illustrate applications of the method, results of several calculations are presented . in these illustrations total forces and moments are compared /1/ with results of analytic procedures for a circular plan form with steady downwash conditions, /2/ with results of other theories and with experiment for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 1 at a uniform angle of attack, and /3/ with some experimental results for a rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 2 undergoing pitching and flapping oscillations . also included in the illustrations are results of flutter calculations compared with experimental results for an allmovable control surface of aspect ratio 3.50 and for a cantilevered rectangular plan form of aspect ratio 5.04 .",cran
3807,"3105. studies on the subunits of a-crystallin and their recombi- nation earlier investigations have shown that, in the presence of high concentrations of urea, a-crystallin from bovine lens is split into a number of subunits with apparent- ly different electrophoretic mobilities but similar molecular weights. the recom- bination of these subunits after removal of the urea has been studied by ultracentri- fugation and immunoprecipitation techniques. it was found that maximal recombina- tion was obtained when the ionic strength during the removal of the urea was high (>0.2), whereas at low ionic strengths a molecule with only half the molecular weight of native a-crystallin and a much lower sedimentation coefficient was obtained. a complete recovery of the structure of native a-crystallin was never obtained, even at high ionic strengths, as was evident from electrophoretic and quantitative preci- pitin analyses. the subunits were fractionated by chromatography on deae-cellu- lose in the presence of 7 m urea. the purification was followed by polyacrylamide- gel electrophoresis. after removal of the urea at high ionic strength, 2 of the fractions obtained showed reactions of only partial identity with native a-crystallin in immunodiffusion tests, but all other fractions showed complete identity. the differences in the electrophoretic mobilities of the fractions in the presence of urea persisted after removal of the urea. all fractions had much higher sedimen- tation coefficients in the absence of urea than in its presence, although the values for urea-treated unfractionated a-crystallin obtained after removal of the urea were not reached even at high ionic strengths. the amino acid composition of the fractions was found to differ. these observations suggest that a-crystallin is com- posed of a number of chemically different, but related, subunits of approximately the same size, which are bound together by nonspecific, noncovalent bonds, pos- sibly hydrophobic bonds. moreover, when isolated, these subunits have the ability to associate and form molecules of high molecular weight.",med

3815,"Career Contingencies and the Fate of Sociological Research During the past three hundred years the journal article has become the main institutionalized form of formal scholarly communication. Potential contributions to a discipline acquire credibility because they have been published in a reputable journal (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). Who published what and where therefore becomes a central question in the understanding of scholarly, and in particular scientific, disciplines. There have recently been a number of investigations concerning the career of such publications. This career, I suggest, can be conceptualized into three stages. 1) Pre-publication. Here the scholar writes the article, circulates it to colleagues and perhaps presents it at formal and informal meetings (Garvey, Lin and Nelson, 1971). 2) Publication. Here the article is submitted to one or more journals for publication consideration (Zuckerman and Merton, 1971). 3) Post-publication. Here colleagues either ignore the published article or reward it through citations to it in their own work. The practice of citing a colleague's work is perhaps the main way in which scholars indicate what they consider to be a contribution to their discipline.",cisi
3816,"a method of calculating the short period longitudinal stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady compressible flow . a method of calculating the short period longitudinal stability derivatives of a wing in linearised unsteady compressible flow . a method is developed for the calculation of the pressure distribution and the aerodynamic forces and moments on a wing performing harmonic pitching and heaving oscillations . the calculation is based on the assumption of inviscid potential flow without shock waves and is restricted to small incidence, so that the linearized theory is valid . in contrast to other work in the field the theory applies to all mach numbers . it is restricted to small values of the reduced frequency and should be valid for the usual range of short periods occurring at present in flight . the formal solution yields two integral equations for the parts of the load, which are in phase and go out of phase with the oscillation,. these are of the same form as the corresponding equation in steady flow . the way is thus opened for solutions over the whole mach number range at small frequencies, if the corresponding steady solutions can be found . the calculation is in fact easiest for m = 1 and has been done here for delta-wings to supplement a previous supersonic calculation, made on different frequency assumptions, which broke down near m = 1 . it appears from the two sets of results that the short period oscillation will be unstable near m = 1, if the apex angle of the delta wing is greater than about 60 . this confirms a now generally recognised trend . such results near m = 1 must of course be invalidated to an unknown extent by thickness viscosity and shock waves at their maximum effect . nevertheless it is unlikely that these factors will remove the critical nature of the transonic damping as calculated by this method . with all its obvious limitations this method, when extended to other planforms, should provide a useful tool in studying the effect of geometrical parameters on the stability of an aircraft at transonic speeds .",cran

3848,"palliation by radiotherapy the purpose of radiotherapy in the management of cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease; second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist- ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief of suffering to those who are symptomatic and in- curable. cancers of the lung vary quite widely in their response to radiation. those of glandular origin, the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not of modest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis- tant. the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat- cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re- sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas. most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cell carcinoma and as such may be considered to be moderately radiosensitive in much the same order of magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of the skin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, be curable by this means in the same degree. unfor- tunately, this has to date not been found to be true. the reasons are principally two: first and foremost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancer of the lung has more often than not, estimated at 80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin, thus making cure by any effective means presently available unlikely. second, the substrate in which the cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation less well than do the tissues which surround the highly radiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma of the skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un- favorable therapeutic ratio.",med

3853,"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions The essay that follows is the first full published report on a project originally conceived almost fifteen years ago. At that time I was a graduate student in theoretical physics already within sight of the end of my dissertation. A fortunate involvement with an experimental college course treating physical science for the non-scientist provided my first exposure to out-of-date scientific theory and practice radically undermined some of my basic conceptions about the nature of science and the reasons for its special success. Those conceptions were ones I had previously drawn partly from scientific training itself and partly from a long-standing avocational interest in the philosophy of science. Somehow, whatever their pedagogic utility and their abstract plausibility, those notions did not at all fit the enterprise that historical study displayed. Yet they were and are fundamental to many discussions of science, and their failures of verisimilitude therefore seemed thoroughly worth pursuing. The result was a drastic shift in my career plans, a shift from physics to history of science and then, gradually, from relatively straightforward historical problems back to the more philosophical concerns that had initially led me to history. Except for a few articles, this essay is the first of my published works in which these early concerns are dominant. In some part it is an attempt to explain to myself and to friends how I happened to be drawn from science to its history in the first place.",cisi

The referee is thus an example of status-judges who are charged with evaluating the quality of role-performance in a social system. They are found in every institutional sphere. Other kinds of status-judges include teachers assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers), critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in sports. Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for that performance. They influence the motivation to maintain or to raise standards of performance.",cisi
