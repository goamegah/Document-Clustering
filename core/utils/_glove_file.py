word2vec embeddings start with a line with the number of lines (tokens?) and
the number of dimensions of the file. This allows gensim to allocate memory
accordingly for querying the model. Larger dimensions mean larger memory is
held captive. Accordingly, this line has to be inserted into the GloVe
embeddings file.
